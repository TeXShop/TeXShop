I'd like to request a new magic comment for TeXShop that would allow one to set environment variables for the typesetting process. \'a0E.g.:\
\
% !TEX environment = TEXINPUTS=/path/to/the/local/folder//:\
\
This comment should execute `export TEXINPUTS=/path/to/the/local/folder//:` before calling the engine, thereby adding the specified directory to the list that TeX searches for input files (including packages and class).\
\
Note: If making it possible to set arbitrary environment variables for the typesetting process is some kind of security risk, I'm primarily interested in being able to set TEXINPUTS and BIBINPUTS.\

My use case for this feature is a git repository with the following structure:\
\
repository/\
| custom.cls\
| sources/\
| | source1.tex\
| | source2.tex\
| | source3.tex\
| | source4.png\
| | source5.pdf\
| | source6.png\
| | ...\
| --------------\
| document1/\
| | Main.tex\
| --------------\
| document2/\
| | Main.tex\
| --------------\
----------------\
\
Each document pulls in some (but not all) of the common material in the sources directory, add some material which is specific to the document itself, and uses the custom class file to format it. \'a0In order for the document to find the class file, I currently add a symlink to it in each document folder. \'a0That works fine for me because I'm comfortable creating symlinks on the command line. \'a0However, I'm trying to convince some collaborators to get involved who aren't comfortable with the command line and thus who have trouble creating new documents on their own using this method. \'a0My thought was that the new magic comment would enable me to add the repository's root directory to the search path, thereby eliminating the need for the symlink.\

Dear Richard Koch,\
\
With the present version of TeXShop (3.75) I encounter the following problem (with did not occur in the previous versions).\
When I want to search something in the pdf, I use the button ... , I type the searched word and the list of occurrences quickly appears on one side of the window.\
\
In the previous versions, the arrows up/down of the keyboard allowed to go from one occurrence to the previous/next one so that in a big document the search process was very easy and very efficient.\
\
In the present version, the same keys only make the pdf move one small step up or down. I tried hard to change the prefs of TeXShop to recover the previous facility, with no success at all.\
\
I use Mac OS Sierra 10.12.2 ; the problem arises with a desk iMac and an iBookPro.\
\
Thanks in advance for your help.\
\
Best regards\
\
Sincerely yours\

5) Indents in Tags menu to make items easier to find\
\
6) Command to paste as a comment -- Gale\
\
7) Modified the Help menu document "First Steps with TeXShop" and the document  "Quickstart Guide for Command Completion" in  ~/LibraryTeXShop/Documents \
\
\
TO BE FIXED LATER\
\
8) Contextual menus for the preview window don't work until the corresponding menu items are used\
ONCE. After that, everything is OK until the file is typeset. Then the fix has to be applied again.\

Koch: I suspect this is related to a problem in the log window when TeXShop first opens, warning\
that there is a problem with the drawer window and "become first responder"\

\f0 \cf0 Hello,\
\
I have been using TeXShop for editing LaTeX and am very pleased with it.\
\
However, I've noticed an annoying usability bug: namely (at least when working in a one-window setting), scrolling with the touchpad gesture works very awkwardly: instead of the editor limiting the scrolling to vertical scrolling, as most OS X applications do, TexShop does not: so unless a person scrolls perfectly vertically on the touchpad (we're human afterall and this is difficult), the editor will scroll sideways, stop, and hang etc.\
\
I would propose limiting the scrolling to vertical scroll only \'97 as anyway no content shows up when you scroll horizontally. For this editor, horizontal scroll should not even exist.\
\
Thanks for taking note of that, and thanks for the awesome app !\
\
Best,\
