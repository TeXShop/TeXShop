/* Localized Strings: English */

/* The real name of this file is "Localizable.strings". I have added the
tex at the end so the file can be examined with TeXShop and important
comments will stand out.*/

/* Some of these localizations are crucial; if they are not made correctly,
the program will not work. The crucial localizations are names of menu items;
internal program code sometimes searches for menus by name. Crucial items are
marked below with a TeX comment sign. Some menu names are added by the
program and cannot be found in nib files; these are noted with "not in IB". These
strings will not break the program if not translated, but then some menu names will
appear in English. */
