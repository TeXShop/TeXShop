<P><h3>About the Preliminary Release of TeXShop 4.08</h3></P>

This preliminary version of TeXShop 4.08 works on Yosemite and above, but has been compiled on Mojave. The main purpose of the release is to fix TeXShop bugs when running on Mojave, and to support Dark Mode there. The "Changes" document in the Help menu is complete and describes all bug fixes and new features present.

<P><h5>Required User Actions</h5></P>

<p> When older versions of TeXShop run on Mojave, some tools are missing. This problem is fixed in 4.08, and will not be seen  if version 4.08 is the only version of TeXShop that has run on a user's Mojave system.

<p> But users who ran an earlier TeXShop on Mojave will have to take one of two actions to restore their tools. The easiest is to make sure TeXShop is not running and throw away ~/Library/Preferences/TeXShop.plist. Then run version 4.08. Tools will reappear. Reset any preference item you may have changed.

<p> If that is too drastic, another solution is to open  a project which has both a source window and a preview window, With the source window active, select the Windows menu item "Customize Toolbar..." and drag the custom set of tools to the toolbar. Repeat this operation with the preview window active. Then with the source window active, select the Windows menu item "Use One Window." Both source and preview will appear in a single window. With this window active, select the Windows menu "Customize Toolbar..." and drag the custom set of tools to the single-window toolbar.

<P><h5>More on This Release</h5></P>

<p>
All localizations are present and should work.

<p>
The current source code is provided with this release. The file "globals.h" in this source defines two names
<pre>
     #define	   HIGHSIERRAORHIGHER
	
     #define	   MOJAVEORHIGHER
</pre>
When both are defined, the source will only compile on Mojave. When only the first is defined, the source will compile on High Sierra. When neither is defined, the source should compile on Sierra.

<p> The version of 4.08 on this site now requires the Golden Master of XCode 10 to compile. This version was released to developers on September 12, and should be available to everyone on September 21.
 
<p> Please report bugs.  If you are using a localization other than English, it is useful to temporarily switch to English, so you can determine if the bug is in a localization or instead in program code. Please do not request new features at this time; my plate is temporarily full.

<p> TeXShop Preferences has a new tab in which all colors are listed together, and can be set as a group. A full group of colors is known as a "Theme". Users can create as many themes as they like. The Changes document explains how this works in detail, and how to recover the file containing a theme and send it by email to others.

<p> I am not a competent color designer, so I have spent no time perfecting the dark theme shipped with this release, or any other of the sample themes. I'm hoping that some users will contribute improved themes or new themes that could be part of the release. Credit will be given to designers when the final release occurs. We desperately need an improved dark theme. I've seen  beautiful themes on the web; it would be easy to convert these to the new file format in 4.08, and I hope their authors will submit them.

<p> When Mojave is released, or possibly before that, this version will be released to everyone running the current 4.01. It will be called 4.08. It will certainly work on Sierra and High Sierra because I have tested it there, and probably will work on all systems running 4.01. The new themes work on all systems, but Dark Mode requires Mojave.
