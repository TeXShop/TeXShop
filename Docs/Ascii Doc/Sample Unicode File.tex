% !TEX encoding = UTF-8 Unicode

Notice the magic line above. This line tells TeXShop to  open or save this file using the UTF-8 encoding, even though you use a different default encoding, MacOSRoman. The advantage of UTF-8 is that it preserves every character typed on the screen.

In this file, some lines are standard ascii text, including the following line which is LaTeX source:

$$\int_0^\infty e^{- x^2} \ dx = {{{\sqrt{\pi}} \over 2}$$

This file also has some German text. Notice that the text below has umlauts. Of course it is easy to create this output in TeX using control characters, but this is a source file, and so the characters with umlauts below aren't standard Ascii characters.
But a German keyboard can certainly insert them into the text.

	Sea voyage = Fußgängerübergänge
	
However, TeXShop allows much fancier input. I don't know any of the  languages below, but I'll just type random characters.

Hebrew:  איןדםר׳פע
Arabic: فاخصهقع بسيب
Burma: အတသငကျူမငနဘ
So this file is an example of a file infected by a virus!
