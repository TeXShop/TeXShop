Version 1.28	January 31, 2003\
\
	Martin Kerz creates http based help system from earlier rtf documents.\
	The system is localized in German by Kerz, and in Spanish by\
	Juan Luis Varona Malumbres. In all other localizations, http help is\
	currently in English. This document is created; it will\
	contain a history of all English changes to this http help.\
\
	To localize help, translate the http files once. From that point on,\
	look at this document for English changes, and incorporate these\
	changes in your translation.}
