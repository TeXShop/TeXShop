Version 1.31	October 22, 2003\
\
	In the Credits panel in Help, added Kevin Ballard to the list of coders\
	and Hendrik Chaltin to the list of localizers.\
\
	In the What's New panel in Help, added the entire top section\
	about version 1.31.\
\
	Modified the second paragraph of .plist Files in How Do I Configure\
	TeXShop. The modified version explains that there are several\
	Macros.plist files.\
\
	Made a similar modification to Plist Files in General Help. Only the\
	second paragraph was changed.\
\
	Modified the text of Preliminaries in Macros Help to explain that Macros\
	now change when the typesetting engine changes.\
\
	Added a final paragraph to Setting Preferences in General Help,\
	explaining the drop down menu to change default preferences for Japanese.\
\
	The Getting and Installing teTeX page in General Help was revised to\
	reflect Gerben Wierda's latest teTeX distribution.\
\
	Typesetting Documents in General Help was edited to remove an extraneous\
	TeXShop at the very end of the page.\
\
	A new file named Adding Personal Sty and Macro Files to TeTeX was added to\
	General Help.\
\
	The files general.htm and hlpindex.htm were modified to point to this\
	new file.\
\
	The first paragraph of the Typesetting Documents file in General Help\
	was modified to indicate that you can switch between source and preview\
	windows using command-1. This used to be control-1.\
