\cf2 Dear Richard,\
\
I am a user of TeXShop in Japan.  I always appreciate your efforts put into\
TeXShop, which is very helpful to MacOS X & TeX users.\
After I downloaded its source code, I have been working on a possible\
improvement and enhancement, whose some features are related to\
Japanese and others are not.\
\
Here is the list of changes I made:\
\
(A) Key filtering for backslash and yen\
(B) Support for other Japanese encodings\
(C) Pasteboard conversion for backslash and yen\
(D) Tags menu with yen character in MacJapanese\
(E) LaTeX panel conversion in MacJapanese\
(F) Yen in Cosole window\
(G) A class EncodingSupport\
\
(H) MacroMenu and MacroEditor\
(I) Magnifying glass in Preview Window\
(J) Command-T for Typeset and program popup button\
(K) The name of new documents: "Unititled-n"\
(L) TeX Input in Console window\
(M) Path Settings on "okButtonPressed:" in TSPreferences\
(N) Support for .def, .fd, .ltx, .clo files\
\
The items (A)-(G) are related to Japanese encodings.\
In MacJapanese encoding, yen symbol was used as the TeX character\
instead of backslash.  I wrote in a separate text "backslash and\
yen.txt" a background information on this problem.\
TeXShop addresses this problem by translating files using MacJapanese\
encoding and dealing separately in coloring and tag routines.  However\
we still experienced several problems and I am proposing some fixes.\
\
The items (I),(K)-(N) are quite easy to incorporate into the source code,\
and you can simply copy and paste the pieces of my source code into the\
original  version 1.25 source code.\
\
The application and the source code is available at\
http://www.kusm.kyoto-u.ac.jp/~mitsu/tex/TeXShop-jx.dmg.sit\
http://www.kusm.kyoto-u.ac.jp/~mitsu/tex/texshopsource-jx.dmg.sit\
\
Additions and changes in the source codes are marked like\
// added by mitsu --(*) explanation\
and\
// end addition\
So you can simply search "mitsu" in an editor to locate where\
they are.  More explanation can be found in the text file\
"ModificationByMitsu.txt" and "backslash and yen.txt" which is\
attached to the source code.\
Please note that my version TeXShop-jx uses the preference file\
"TeXShop-jx.plist"\
so you may have to adjust it at the beginning of usage.  The ReadMe file\
which comes with\
the application is in Japanese and was intended for Japanese testers of\
this version.\
(I learned that Zenitani has been contacting you for Japanese resource and\
ReadMe file.)\
\
I hope that my pieces of code can be of some help for your development.\
Please do not hesitate to contact me for questions or comments.\
\
Best regards,\
\
Mitsu Shishikura\
