At the national TUG meeting in Palo Alto on August 9, 2019, Frank Mittelbach talked about new procedures for the development of LaTeX. He explained that the  team developing modern versions of LaTeX has  a  testbed of documents which they test against before LaTeX releases. But occasionally, bugs are found after a release.

Therefore, the team has adopted a new release step. After a version of LaTeX passes internal tests, a ``dev'' version is released for the three major engines: PdfTeX, XeTeX, and LuaTeX. This version will appear in TeX Live. Users should occasionally test  their projects against this version, because if it passes these external tests, it will become the official release of LaTeX.

Consequently, three new engines are provided for TeXShop: LuaLaTeX-dev, PdfLatex-dev, and XeLaTeX-dev. They work exactly like LuaLaTeX, PdfLaTeX. and XeLaTeX except that they use the latest ``dev'' version of LaTeX.
