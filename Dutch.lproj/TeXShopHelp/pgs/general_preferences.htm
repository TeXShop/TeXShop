		<P><font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial">Several items can be changed using the Preference menu: the default font for the input window, the default magnification for the output window, and the default position of these windows when they first appear. You can configure the console so it always appears when typesetting, or only appears when there is an error. </font></P>
		<p><font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial">The preference dialog can also be used to change the commands executed when the &quot;TeX&quot; and &quot;LaTeX&quot; buttons are pushed. This is useful because some users prefer a version of TeX called etex, and there are pdf versions of etex called pdfetex and pdfelatex. Obviously the substituted command must produce a pdf output file. If the new programs are in the teTeX binary directory, it is enough to name them in the preference dialog; the dialog will also accept fully qualified path names for files which live elsewhere.</font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial">TeXShop editing is done with Apple's Cocoa editing class, which uses Unicode for internal work. When TeXShop files are written to disk, they are usually converted to 8-bit ascii because TeX expects to receive such a file. There are several ways to do the conversion: Mac OS Roman, Iso Latin 1, Iso Latin 2, and others. A preference item selects the method used. For many users, the choice will make no difference. Some TeX packages allow users to type accented European characters directly on the keyboard; these packages require the Iso Latin conversion. Thanks to Martin Heusse for providing the original code for this preference. The conversion method can also be selected directly from the Open and Save panels.</font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial">Users in Japan and Korea will use other conversion preferences, also provided.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial">It is possible to reset the background color of the source window. The preference dialog does not have an interface to make this change. To set the background to (r, g, b) = (.42, .39, .77), issue the following commands in Terminal:</font></p>
		<dl>
			<dd><font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial">defaults write edu.uoregon.math.koch.TeXShop background_R 0.42</font>
			<dd><font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial">defaults write edu.uoregon.math.koch.TeXShop background_G 0.39</font>
