		<p>Gerben Wierda has compiled the latest teTeX for MacOSX. His version also includes updated programs from the TeX User's Group's distribution TeXLive. To obtain these files and programs, go to Wierda's site</p>
		<dl>
			<dd><a href="http://www.rna.nl/tex.html">http://www.rna.nl/tex.html </a>
		</dl>
		<p>and obtain i-Installer, the TeX installer. You'll find it in the downloadable package II2.dmg. Run the installer and install the following packages:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>TeX
			<li>Ghostscript 8
			<li>Freetype 2
			<li>wmf and iconv conversion support
			<li>ImageMagick
			<li>CM Super for TeX
			<li> TeX Support: TeX4ht
		</ul>
		<p>The first package are essential for TeX. The second package is necessary to use the TeX + Ghostscript option of TeXShop described below. The third, fourth, and fifth packages are used to convert graphic formats into formats which TeX understands. The sixth package contains an optional set of additional fonts. The final package is necessary to convert TeX source code to web pages. </p>

<p>If you are running Mac OS X 10.3 (Panther) or higher, you may not need to install Ghostscript.
Panther contains its own distiller to convert postscript files to pdf format, and TeXShop has a preference
setting to use that distiller rather than ghostscript. But you still may wish to install ghostscript, since a small number of tex packages use it directly. The most important is epstopdf.sty, which can be used to automatically convert eps files to pdf format during typesetting.
 </p>


		<p>More detailed installation instructions can be found on Wierda's site, and on the TeXShop web site listed later.</p>
