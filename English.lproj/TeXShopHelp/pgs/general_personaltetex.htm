Users sometimes create additional sty, cls, bib, and tex files for common use in several different projects. These files will certainly be seen by tex and latex if they are placed in the same folder as the tex source file being typeset, but then multiple copies of the files must be kept on the
computer. 
 </font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial">
It is possible to make these files visible to all teTeX projects, whether typeset from TeXShop or from the Terminal. To do so, create a subfolder of the Library folder in your home directory named texmf. Create subfolders named tex and bibtex. Within the tex folder, create a subfolder named latex. Store your personal files in these folders.
 </font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial">
Tex will find any file in ~/Library/texmf/tex or a subfolder of this
directory. Latex will find any file in ~/Library/texmf/tex/latex or a subfolder of this directory, and bibtex and makeindex will find any file in ~/Library/texmf/bibtex and ~/Library/texmf/makeindex respectively, or a subfolder. It is not necessary to run texhash after adding files to these folders.
 </font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial">
On other Unix machines, tex is sometimes notified of the location
of personal input files by setting the environment variables
TEXINPUTS, BSTINPUTS, and BIBINPUTS. This is generally not necessary
in Gerben Wierda's teTeX distribution, but it can be done in special
circumstances. Mac OS X allows users to notify programs about  environment variables by creating a file in their home directory named ~/.MacOSX/environment.plist.
These environment variables get picked up by all user shells and all Carbon and Cocoa programs, so caution should be used when creating the file.

Below is a sample environment.plist file sent me by Nathan Potter; thanks!
