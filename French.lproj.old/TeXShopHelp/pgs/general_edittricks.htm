		<P><font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial">Groups of lines can be commented out using a menu command, and later activated again. Groups of lines can be indented with a menu command, and later moved back. If a line starts with a series of tabs or spaces, new lines will start at the same position until the behavior is cancelled by backspacing. This behavior was added to TeXShop by Nicol&aacute;s Ojeda B&auml;r in Argentina, who can be reached at <a href="mailto:lojedaortiz@interlink.com.ar">lojedaortiz@interlink.com.ar</a>. Thanks!</font></P>

The source window can be split in two pieces using the split tool at the top of the window. When it is split, two views of the same source are
shown. You can type in either piece and your changes will immediately appear in the other as well. Thus you can modify one section of
source while reading a second part of the source.

TeXShop can be instructed to create a backup file every time a file is saved or typeset. This is set using a hidden preference.
To create backup files, open Terminal and type the following command:
</font></P>
		<dl>
			<dd><font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial"><tt>defaults write TeXShop SaveBackup YES</tt></font>
		</dl>
<P><font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial"> Change YES to NO to stop creating backups.
</font></P>

File icons can be dragged and dropped onto the source text. If the file is a tex file, an \input command will be
added with a relative path to the file. If the file is a graphic file, an \includegraphics command will be
added instead. The following graphic types are recognized: pdf, jpg, jpeg, tif, tiff, eps, ps.
</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial">
Dropping a cls file produces \documentclass and a file reference, dropping a sty file produces
\usepackage, dropping a bib file produces \bibliographystyle, and dropping other text files
produces \input.
</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial">
The behavior of drag and drop is user customizable. Customization is done with the Macro menu. Insert a new submenu
titled "Drag & Drop". Inside this submenu place items named with the extension whose behavior
you wish to customize, and place the code that should be inserted in the body of this item.
For instance, if the item is .pdf, the code might be \includegraphics[#INS#]{%r}. In these inclusions,
the following abbreviations may be used:

<dl>
<dd>	%F full path of an dropped file
<dd>	%f dropped filename
<dd>	%r relative path of the dropped file
<dd>	%n filename without extension
<dd>	%e extension.
</dl>
</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial">
If an extension is not mentioned in the Macro Editor, then it is
handled in the default manner mentioned earlier. Thus for
most people, no macro "Drag & Drop" submenu is needed.
