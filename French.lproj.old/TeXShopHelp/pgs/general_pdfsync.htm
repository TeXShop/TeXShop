		<P><font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial">Synchronization is an important feature of Textures, a commercial implementation of TeX for
Mac Classic by Blue Sky TeX Systems. Using this feature,  an author can click in the preview window and immediately be taken to the corresponding spot in the source window. A native version of Textures for MacOS X is promised but has not yet been released. </font></P>

 <P><font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial">The implementation of synchronization in Textures is widely admired for its ability to precisely locate the corresponding spot in the source code. I've been told that Blue Sky TeX Systems rewrote TeX to provide the information needed for this feature, but I do not know the details of their implementation.
</font></P> 

<P><font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial">Since this implementation, a number of TeX systems on other platforms have provided approximately the same feature using an additional style file which causes TeX to write extra information to. the dvi file. This summer, Piero D'Ancona wrote a somewhat similar style file for pdflatex.
This package, pdfsync.sty, causes pdftex to write an extra file during typesetting with information needed to correlate the output pdf and input source files. D'Ancona's work depends on internal pdftex commands which output the x and y coordinates of certain typesetting operations </font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial">Recently,Jérôme Laurens joined D'Ancona's project, contributing changes to the pdfsync package. Laurens then implemented pdf syncing in iTeXMac; his implementation
is the first and currently the most robust implementation on a tex front end for Mac OS X.</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial">TeXShop 1.34 begins the process of bringing these developments to TeXShop. To use pdfsync, it is necessary to find the pdfsync.sty file in the TeXShop distribution and place it in
~/Library/texmf/tex/latex. Eventually this file will become part of Gerben Wierda's tex distribution.
The pdfsync feature is only available in pdflatex and context; it does not work with the tex + ghostscript typesetting option.</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial">To use pdfsync, add the following line to the
preamble of your tex source code before the \begin{document} line:
<dl>
<dd>\usepackage{pdfsync}
</dl>
This package will be ignored if you typeset with tex + ghostscript, but if you typeset with pdflatex, an extra file will be created with extension .pdfsync. For example, if the
source file is named main.tex, the extra file will be named main.pdfsync. This extra file contains the information needed to correlate spots in the pdf file with spots in the source file. Most files should typeset without errors using pdfsync, but in a small number of cases, this package might introduce extra errors. Please report such cases to D'Ancona, Laurens, or me. 
</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial"> Once a file has been typeset with pdfsync, click on a spot in the pdf preview window while holding down the command key. The source window will be brought to the front, the line containing the corresponding source will be selected, and the window will scroll to this line if necessary. If a project contains a root file and additional chapter files added with \include, and if the spot in the preview window corresponds to source code from an included chapter file, the chapter file will open, appear at the front, and scroll to the appropriate spot in the source.
</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial"> In this initial implementation, the selected line will be roughly correct but the actual source code may be a few lines lower or higher. D'Ancona's pdfsync file contains additional information which can locate the source spot more precisely, and code to use that information will be added to TeXShop as soon as possible. 
</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial"> Currently, pdfsync does not work if source files are \input.
Thus \include works, but \input does not. This restriction may later be removed.
</font></P>
