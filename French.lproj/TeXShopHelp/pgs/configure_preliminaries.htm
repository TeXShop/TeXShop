		<P><font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial">Please read only the first section below if you are a new user installing TeXShop for the first time. If you are upgrading from a previous version, read this and the next four sections. If you are familiar with TeXShop and want to customize it, read the remaining sections.</font></P>
		<p><font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial">When TeXShop first runs, it places default preference items and templates in the user's library folder. If the program is later updated, these preference items and templates are not modified because the user may have edited them. In a few cases, important changes were made in the default items; these changes are listed here so users of previous versions can modify preferences and templates appropriately.</font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial">TeXShop has a few hidden preferences for power users. Such users can also modify program behavior by installing various plist files. Details are provided below.</font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial">New versions of TeXShop sometimes require additional menu items and other interface components. These new items appear in English even when the rest of the interface has been localized for another language. If users write me with appropriate translations, I will immediately make the changes in the copy of TeXShop on my web site. Write <a href="mailto:koch@math.uoregon.edu">koch@math.uoregon.edu</a>. </font></p>
