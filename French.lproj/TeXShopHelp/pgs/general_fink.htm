		<P><font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial">Mac OS X can also run X-windows applications using free third party software. These applications run side by side with regular Mac OS X programs. Fink is a system which can download and compile these applications on Mac OS X. For details, see http://fink.sourceforge.net. In particular, Fink can install ghostview, xdvi, and xemacs.</font></P>
		<p><font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial">Fink installs software in /sw/bin. One of the packages Fink can install is teTeX. In the past this caused problems because users had duplicate copies of teTeX, configured one of the copies, and then found that the configuration did not affect the other copy. The latest version of Fink gives the option of using Gerben Wierda's teTeX with symbolic links in /sw/bin rather than installing a second copy. We recommend that you choose that option.</font></p>
