<P><font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial"> Version 1.32 addes two extra features to TeXShop and fixes some bugs.
</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial"> New features:
</font>
<ul>
<li> <font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial">
There is a new menu item, "New Tag", which inserts an empty tag in the
					source text and positions the cursor so the user can add the name of the tag.
					As a corollary, there is now a keystroke to add a new tag; the keystroke
					is command-2.
</font>

<li> <font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial">
In Applescript macros, the terms #LOGPATH#, #AUXPATH#, #INDPATH#,
					#BBLPATH#, and #HTMLPATH# will now be recognized; this has been added
					at the request of Claus Gerhardt.
</font>


</ul>

<p><font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial"> Bugs fixed:
</font>
		<ul>
<font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial">
<li> Although the magnification level can increase to 1000 in version 1.31, 
					the arrow keys next to the magnification control only allowed values up to
					400. This is fixed.


<li> If the preview window's toolbar was in text-only mode and the magnification
					panel was selected, the resulting small dialog window would not go away
					in 1.31. This is fixed. 

<li> In Preferences, if the user set the tab size or the preview window magnification
					and then cancelled, the new values would still appear when the Preference
					panel was again displayed. This is fixed.

<li> Suppose the preference to place the first page on the right side is active.
					In 1.31, the left arrow key did now work in double page mode, and the right arrow
					key stopped one page before the end. In double multipage mode, the end
					key, the page down key, and the right arrow key stopped before displaying
					the last page. All of these problems are fixed.

</ul>


<P><font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial"> Version 1.31 addes some extra features to TeXShop and fixes several bugs.
</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial"> New features:
</font>
<ul>
<li> <font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial">
Macros items are now specific to the typesetting engine set in the current
window. Two default sets are created when TeXShop first starts, one for
Latex and one for Context. (The Context set was created by Hans Hagen;
thanks!). Suppose a different engine is selected, say TeX. When it
starts, it will have the default Latex macros. But if this set of Macros
is edited with the Macro editor, the new set will always be associated
with TeX, while the old Latex macros will continue to be associated
with Latex. Of course the Latex macros can also be changed.
</font>

<li> <font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial">
A new preference item allows the first page in the two double page modes
to be either on the left or on the right. Books usually put this page on
the right, so that is the default preference.
</font>

<li> <font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial">
The preference dialog has a new pulldown menu to reset preferences to
default values. This addition was requested by Seiji Zenitani for users in
Japan who must cope with three different versions of pTeX. These users can
now rapidly set preferences without consulting documentation on web sites.
</font>

<li> <font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial">
The largest possible magnification in the preview window is
now 1000 (previously it was 400).
</font>

<li> <font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial">
Additional French menu translations by Hendrik Chaltin; thanks!

<p><font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial"> Bugs fixed:
</font>
		<ul>
<font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial">
<li> Three Panther problems are fixed. A few interface changes
were made to improve appearance in Panther. This
release is essential for Panther. 

<ul>
	<li> In Panther, older versions of TeXShop refuse to create
	new files, although they can open existing files. This was fixed 
	by adding two lines to the "displayName" code.

	<li> In Panther, the small yellow tags which display the current
	page when scrolling in multipage and double multipage display
	formats were blank. Also, the small yellow tags which display
	the size of a selection rectangle to copy
	a portion of the pdf window were blank. This is fixed.

	<li> On my system, Panther spellchecking often fails for all
	programs. This happens at boot time. The computer boots
	up, but even if the first program used is TextEdit or Mail, it refuses
	to "spell check as you type" and the "Spelling dialog" refuses
	to appear. I suspect this is due to a defective third party program on my
	disk, since other Panther users haven't seen the problem. But
	I haven't been able to isolate the bug. Once the problem occurs, TextEdit and Mail have minor text
	input glitches which are cured by turning off continuous spell
	checking. TeXShop had more serious glitches in this situation.
	So in 1.31, extra code has been added to turn off continuous
	spell checking when TeXShop starts if the spell checker is not
	available.

	</ul>

<li> Fixed a bug reported by Luis Sequeira: when text was dragged within
the source window, it was always copied and pasted. It should have been cut and
pasted unless the option key was down. This is fixed. 

<li> Juan Luis Varona Malumbres slightly improved Spanish help (small
icon for the list of help files in the drawer).

<li> In two page mode, typesetting no longer scrolls to the first
page.

<li> The new page and magnification buttons retain firstResponder
status (as before 1.29) so users can experiment with several
settings without clicking again for each experiment.

<li> In version 1.30 and before, if the user input an impossible line 
into the "Go To Line" dialog, the program could crash; this is fixed. 
Thanks to Eric Seidel for the bug report.

<li> Kevin Ballard, kevin@sb.org, contributed a new English.lproj folder
with revised placement of interface items in preferences, slightly revised
menu items, and other changes to improve the look of the interface
in Panther. Many thanks!

<li> Made spacing changes for Panther in the German preference panel.
Thanks to Martin Kerz for the suggestions.

<li> There is a hidden preference item to turn off tag computation:
"defaults write TeXShop TagSections NO" but this preference was disabled
somewhere along the line and certainly in 1.30. It is enabled again.
<font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial">

<li> The Preference window is no longer hidden when the program is
deactivated.

</ul>
