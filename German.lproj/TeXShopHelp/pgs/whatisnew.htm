		<p><font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial">Version 1.29 adds a number of extra features to TeXShop and fixes several bugs. </font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial">New features: </font></p>
		<ul>
			<li><font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial">New PDF display options have been provided by Mitsuhiro Shishikura. The original page by page option is still available, but it is now also possible to scroll through the entire pdf document or to display two pages side by side. The default choice can be set in Preferences and the display can later be changed by menu action. </font>
			<li><font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial">Shishikura has also modified the magnification options for preview display. The original option is still available, but it is now possible to display in actual size, or fit the display to the size of the window. A default choice can be set in Preferences and the magnification behavior can later be changed at will by menu. </font>
			<li><font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial">The magnification glass behavior has changed slightly. A toolbar item fixes the size of the region to be magnified; double or triple clicking enlarges this region. </font>
			<li><font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial">It is possible to select a portion of the pdf preview display and copy and paste the resulting graphic into another program. Drag and drop of the selection is also supported. Preference items allow users to select the file type of the copy (pdf, png, jpg, tiff, etc.) and the foreground and background colors and transparency. This feature is also due to Shishikura. </font>
			<li><font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial">Preview selection combined with drag and drop can be used with Keynote. Using the default copy preferences, a text selection can be dropped on a Keynote slide; the background of the text will be transparent, so the slide background will show between the letters. This text can be resized since the default copy format is pdf. </font>
			<li><font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial">Seiji Zenitani has added the ability to drag and drop files onto the source window. If a tex file is dropped, an &quot;\input &quot; command will be added there with a relative path to the file. If a graphic file is dropped, an &quot;\includegraphics &quot; command will be added. </font>
			<li><font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial">Shishikura also added command completion. Type the first few letters of a word and hit the escape key. The remaining letters will be entered. Hitting escape again will cycle through all possible completions. Initially this will have limited usefulness because the completion dictionary is almost empty. To add a word to the dictionary, select the word and choose &quot;Add Word&quot; under the Format menu. Notice that this menu command has a key equivalent. To see and edit the entire dictionary, choose &quot;Open Completion File&quot; under the Format menu. Notice that the completion can be more complicated than just a single word, and the cursor can be placed correctly within this completion. Examine the samples provided in the default file for details. This feature will be improved in later versions. </font>
			<li><font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial">The source window can now be split, so one section can be viewed and written while another portion is also visible. Keyboard input can go to either split portion and will also immediately appear in the other portion. </font>
			<li><font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial">The source and preview window toolbars now work in text only mode. </font>
			<li><font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial">TeXShop now has support for ISO Latin 5 (used in Turkey) and for several Russian formats. Vladimir Novikov provided helpful information about formats to support. </font>
			<li><font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial">Some users must deal with a number of file encodings. For these users, the open and save panels now allow the file encoding to be individually chosen for a file. When a file is first opened, the default choice for this encoding will be the one listed in preferences, so most users can ignore this new choice. If a different encoding is chosen when a file is opened, that encoding will be the default choice when the file is later saved. </font>
			<li><font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial">A small number of users ran into the following problem. They would receive a file with one encoding, say UTF-8, but mistakenly open it with another encoding, say Mac OS Roman. If they did not notice the problem, they might typeset the file. Typesetting always saves the file first, so the original file would be overwritten with a file in a different encoding, losing information. TeXShop now has a hidden preference to provide some protection in this situation. When this preference is active, TeXShop will create a backup file before it saves or typesets a file. To turn this on, type the following command in Terminal:</font>
			<ul>
				<li>defaults write TeXShop SaveBackup YES
			</ul>
			</font>
			<li><font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial">Support for epsi files was added. </font>
			<li><font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial">The default commands for pdftex and pdflatex are now &quot;pdftex --shell-escape&quot; and &quot;pdflatex --shell-escape.&quot; The &quot;shell-escape&quot; portion of this text tells pdftex that it is legal to run other programs during typesetting. This is useful because if tex finds a graphic file in an unsupported format, it can automatically call another program to convert it to supported format. For example, the default Latex template automatically converts tif files to png and automatically converts eps files to pdf. </font>
			<li><font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial">This creates one difficulty that may worry some users. The &quot;shell-escape&quot; flag allows pdftex to run ANY program. Thus a disgruntled student could send you a tex source file by email and when you typeset it you would discover that some of the files in your directory had been erased. </font>
			<li><font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial">I believe the danger is slight. A source file which did harm would have to be created deliberately; sending a &quot;virus&quot; via tex source seems somewhat esoteric. Nevertheless, there are two ways that you can protect yourself. The first and easiest is to remove the letters &quot;--shell-escape&quot; from the two spots they occur in Preferences and then convert all of your graphic files by hand. </font>
			<li><font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial">TeXShop now provides a different protection. A preference item under the Engine tab is labeled &quot;Shell Escape Warning;&quot; this item is off when TeXShop is delivered. If the item is on and &quot;shell-escape&quot; is active, then the first time a file is typeset during a TexShop session, a warning dialog will appear allowing you to turn shell-escape off for that particular file. This dialog will not appear again during the session for that particular file. Thus you can typeset your own files using &quot;shell-escape&quot; and typeset files received in the mail without &quot;shell-escape.&quot; </font>
			<li><font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial">TeXShop can now create submenus in the Templates menu. To do so, create folders in the Templates folder. This code was written by Seiji Zenitani. </font>
			<li><font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial">It has always been possible to color TeX output. To do so, add the line</font>
			<ul>
				<li>\usepackage{color}
			</ul>
			to the preamble, and insert a line like
			<ul>
				<li>\color{blue}
			</ul>
			before typesetting begins. To color a limited section of text, use a command like
			<ul>
				<li>{\color{red} This is very important!}
			</ul>
			To define custom colors, use a command like
			<ul>
				<li>\definecolor{mycolor}{rgb}{0.2, 0.7, 0.8}
			</ul>
			</font>
			<li><font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial">When output is colored, the output may be difficult to read on the preview screen. TeXShop has hidden preferences to set the background color of the preview window. This background color will not appear when the document is printed. To set the background to gray, issue the following commands in Terminal:</font>
			<ul>
				<li>defaults write TeXShop Pdfbackground_R 0.5
				<li>defaults write TeXShop Pdfbackground_G 0.5
				<li>defaults write TeXShop Pdfbackground_B 0.5
			</ul>
			<li><font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial">Change 0.5 to 1 to get back to white. If you find yourself changing the background often, create an Applescript macro named &quot;PDF background gray&quot; with the Macro Editor using the following text:</font>
			<ul>
				<li>--AppleScript
				<li>do shell script &quot;defaults write TeXShop Pdfbackground_R 0.5&quot;
				<li>do shell script &quot;defaults write TeXShop Pdfbackground_G 0.5&quot;
				<li>do shell script &quot;defaults write TeXShop Pdfbackground_B 0.5&quot;
			</ul>
			and create a similar macro named &quot;PDF background white&quot;.</font>
			<li><font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial">The German help file was revised by Martin Kerz and Laurent Meister. Additional French localization was provided by Jean-Claude De Soza. Additional Spanish localization was provided by Juan Luis Varona Malumbres. </font>
		</ul>
		<p><font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial">Bugs fixed: </font></p>
		<ul>
			<li><font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial">Undo is now permitted past typesetting operations and file saves. Thus it is possible to typeset and then undo several changes made before the typesetting command. This bug was fixed earlier, but the fix created problems and had to be removed. Now the fix is back for good. </font>
			<li><font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial">When a user closed a document and then tried to throw the pdf away, the Finder complained that it was still open. TeXShop would have to quit before the pdf could be thrown away. This bug was fixed by Wolfgang Lux. </font>
			<li><font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial">The error coding failed for the new root file behavior. If &quot;chapter1&quot; had a root file, then after typesetting, control-E and the error menu command would be inactive. This is fixed. </font>
			<li><font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial">The \phi and \varphi symbols were reversed in the Latex Panel. This was reported by Oleg Skipa and Rob Leigh and is now fixed. The code inserted by the &quot;[&quot; and &quot;]&quot; symbols in the Latex Panel is now correct, and the cursor is conveniently placed for the &quot;Equations&quot; entry. </font>
			<li><font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial">The metapost script was improved by Joseph C. Slater. </font>
			<li><font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial">Some international characters in autocompletion.plist were repaired by Alexander Wittig. </font>
			<li><font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial">In German, the latex panel initially required two clicks to open. This is fixed. </font>
		</ul>
