		<P><font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial">We will use the AppleScript "pdflatexc" by Claus Gerhardt to illustrate the principles involved in calling a Unix shell script from an Applescript.
This particular shell script isn't very interesting; it adds the location of the teTeX binary files to the $PATH variable and calls pdflatex to typeset.</font></P>

	<P><font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial">The shell script itself is independent of
TeXShop and can be run from the Terminal by typing "pdflatexc myfile.tex" provided the directory holding pdflatexc is in the search path for binaries. Here is that shell script:

<dl>
<dd>#!/bin/tcsh
<dd># pdflatexc
<dd># Claus Gerhardt
<dd>#
<dd># Usage
<dd># pdflatexc filename.tex
<p>
<dd>set path= ($path /usr/local/teTeX/bin/powerpc-apple-darwin-current /usr/local/bin)
<p>
<dd>pdflatex --shell-escape "$1"
</dl>

Of course you are likely to write a more complicated script which performs several operations
in sequence. That is when these techniques become useful.
 </font></P>

 <P><font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial">The AppleScript used to call this shell script is more interesting. Here it is:

<dl>
<dd>--Applescript
<dd>-- Apply only to an already saved file.
<dd>-- Claus Gerhardt, Nov. 2003
<p>
<dd>set scriptPath to (do shell script "dirname " & "~/Library/TeXShop/Scripts/ex")
<dd>set scriptPath to scriptPath & "/setname.scpt"
<dd>set scriptName to POSIX file scriptPath as alias
<dd>set scriptLiB to (load script scriptName)
<dd>tell scriptLib
<dd>set frontName to setname(#NAMEPATH#,#TEXPATH#)
<dd>end tell
<p>
<dd>set fileName to  #TEXPATH#
<dd>set n to (number of characters of contents of fileName)
<dd>set fileNamequoted to quoted form of fileName
<dd>set baseName to do shell script "basename " & fileNamequoted
<dd>set m to (number of characters of contents of baseName)
<dd>set dirName to quoted form of (characters 1 thru (n - m - 1) of fileName as string)
<p>
<dd>set shellScript to "cd " & dirName & ";"
<dd>set shellScript to shellScript & "~/Library/TeXShop/bin/pdflatexc  " & baseName
<dd>do shell script shellScript
<p>
<dd>tell document frontName
<dd>	refreshpdf
<dd>end tell
</dl>
</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial">
Ignoring the introductory comments, the first seven lines of this script  are a magic recipe 
by Claus Gerhardt to save the source file and find the name of the document in question, setting
"frontName" to this name. This recipe uses a compiled script named "setpath.scpt" in
~/Library/TeXShop/Scripts to do all the hard work. Careful reading shows that these lines
find the path ~/Library/TeXShop/Scripts/setname.scpt and call this script with parameters
#NAMEPATH# and #TEXPATH#.
</font></P>
 
<P><font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial">
In many AppleScripts all of this could be accomplished in an earier way using
the commands:
<dl>
<dd> set frontName to #DOCUMENTNAME#
<dd> tell document frontName of application "TeXShop"
<dd> save
<dd> end tell
</dl>
However, Gerhardt's script has two advantages. First, his script can be
called when the front document is a log file, say /Users/koch/Examples/myfile.log, that is,
in a case when the front document is not the document which should receive later commands.
Second, if the file has never been saved, Gerhardt's script returns an error when trying to
save, while the
"save" command would cause TeXShop to hang after it put up a save dialog (see the help document Writing Scripts with TeXShop Typesetting
Commands for details.)
</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial">
The next six lines of the script define the variables dirName and baseName. If the source
file is "/Users/koch/This directory/Stuff/myfile.tex", dirName is " '/Users/koch/This directory/Stuff' ",
including the single and double quotation marks, 
and baseName is "myfile.tex." A lot of this work is required so spaces can occur in the
names of folders. As always, tex does not allow spaces in the final file name.
</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial">
The next three line call the shell script. The result is the same as typing "cd dirName; ~/Library/TeXShop/bin/pdflatexc baseName" in a Terminal, although, to be absolutely precise, dirName would have to be replaced by its unquoted form, i.e., if we use the example above, by '/Users/koch/This directory/Stuff' including the single quotes because of the space in the name of one directory.</font></P>

<P><font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial">
 Shell commands in AppleScript are issued in the form
<dl>
<dd>do shell script "cmd input"
</dl>
If one wants to combine several shell scripts, it is better to write the command in an equivalent form
<dl>
<dd>do shell script "cmd " & "input"
</dl>
Notice the space behind cmd and the quotes. The ampersand is a binary concatenation operator, i.e.,
<dl>
<dd>"cmd " & "input" = "cmd input"
</dl>

When the shell is called via an applescript, the default working directory is the root directory. The command
<dl>
<dd>do shell script "cd " dirName
</dl>
changes the directory to the directory specified in dirName; dirName is already quoted so that additional quotes are not needed. 
<p>
If one would like to keep the working directory and issue further commands, then these commands may not be stated in the form "do shell script", since then a new shell would be invoked. In the terminal one would separate consecutive commands by semicolons, in AppleScript one does it by concatenating ";", i.e.,
<dl>
<dd>do shell script "cmd(1) " & "input(1)" & ";" & "cmd(2) " & "input(2)"
</dl>
This is done in the above example: cmd(1) = cd, "input(1)" = dirName, cmd(2) = ~/Library/TeX/bin/pdflatexc - calling the shell script -, and "input(2)" = baseName.
<p>
The lines
<dl>
<dd>set shellScript to "cd " & dirName & ";"
<dd>set shellScript to shellScript & "~/Library/TeX/bin/pdflatexc  " & baseName
</dl>
are simply a convenient way to concatenate this sequence of commands and input into one variable.

The final three lines update the Preview window.

To be sure, several of these lines are complicated, but these lines can be copied without
change into new scripts.
