		<p>TeXShop is a Mac OS X program which can typeset TeX and LaTeX files and preview the output on the screen. The program usually typesets using pdftex or pdflatex instead of tex or latex. These programs output pdf files rather than dvi files. Since pdf is the native graphics format of Mac OS X, it is easy to display the output on the screen. Pdftex and pdflatex were written by  Han The Thanh, Petr Sojka, and Jiri Zlatuska.<br>
			<br>
			The pdf files created by TeXShop are standard pdf files which can be given to other people and displayed on a variety of computer systems. For example, they can be displayed by Adobe Acrobat on Mac OS 9. <br>
			<br>
			TeXShop does not include TeX. Instead it uses the standard TeX distribution teTeX, a wonderful collection of the entire suite of TeX programs, files, and utilities created by Thomas Esser. This collection (the standard version of TeX on Linux systems) has been compiled for Mac OS X by Gerben Wierda. Instructions for obtaining it are given below.</p>
