<ul>

<li> Added a Matrix Panel by Jonas Zimmermann, zimmerleut@gmx.de. Many
					thanks.

<li>					At the request of Claus Gerhardt, added an extra applescript command,
					"goto line". For instance
<dl>
<dd>						tell front document of application "TeXShop"
<dd>						goto line 15
<dd>						end tell
</dl>
<li>					Added a first cut at pdfsync. Clicking on a spot in the pdf file while holding down
					the command key takes the user to the corresponding point in the source file.
					If the source file has include files,  this operation will open
					the appropriate include file and take the user to a point in that file. Read the
					help file "General Help: Pdfsync" for important details. This change depends
					on pdfsync.sty, a file create by Piero D'Ancona with improvements by Jérôme 
					Laurens.

<li> 					Also added pdfsync the other way. Clicking on a spot in the source file (including
					source files with root files) while holding down the command key will select
					the corresponding page in the pdf file.

</ul>

		<ul>
<font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial">

				<li>	The TeX, Latex, Bibtex, Makeindex, Metapost, Context, and Metafont buttons
					on the toolbar reset the default typesetting engine. This no longer happens.
					Thus it is possible to hit the Bibtex button and then hit command-T to typeset
					again.

<li>					The abort button on the console window did not stay fixed when the window
					was resized. Thanks to Sean Luke for pointing out these first two errors.

<li>					The command-1 keystroke switches back and forth between the source and
					preview windows. In previous versions, this did not work when a source
					window had a root file set by myfile.texshop or %SourceDoc. This is now fixed.
					Clicking command-1 while in the source brings up the corresponding preview
					window. Clicking command-1 again brings up the original source file.
					A given preview window may have several source files. Command-1
					will bring up the last source file which was switched to the preview using
					command-1, or  the root source file if there was no previous switch.

<li>					New Spanish help files by Juan Luis Varona Malumbres. Thanks.

<li>			Printing now respects the "scale" setting in Page Setup. It does not respect the
					"paper size" setting since paper size is set in teTeX. Printing works like this:
					the dimensions of the printed document are set by tex and encoded in the
					pdf file; this pdf is resized by the scale factor if this factor is not 100%, but otherwise
					is placed full size and centered on the printed page; usually the document size
					and printed page size are the same, but in rare cases when they are not,
					the edges of the document might be cut off.

<P><font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial"> Version 1.33 adds extra features to TeXShop and fixes some bugs.
</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial"> New features:
</font>

<p><font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial">
<ul>
<li> The changes in version 1.33 support improved apple scripting,
		better macro support, and improved interaction with external editors.

<li>		Improved macro support was prompted by Claus Gerhardt, who wrote several
		useful scripts included with version 1.33. For example, one script calls htlatex
		to typeset a latex file for the web. The script saves the source, typesets,
		and opens the resulting html file in Safari. Thus the script behaves exactly like
		the Latex typesetting button except that it creates an html rather than a pdf, 
		and displays the html in Safari rather than TeXShop. An advantage of this
		approach is that users can create their own scripts similarly and thus add features
		to TeXShop without waiting for new program code.

<li>		TeX typesetting often requires a sequence of operations. To process a file with
		a bibliography, the source must be run through latex, bibtex must be run, 
		and latex must be run twice more. A script is included to do this automatically.
		The script saves the source before the first latex run and updates the preview display
		at the end. Users can easily customize this script for their own workflow.

<li>		Additional scripts convert the tex source file to a file with Windows line feed
		convention, or a file with Macintosh 9 line feed conventions, or a file with Unix
		line feed conventions. Mac OS X understands all line feeds without help, but
		many computers are not so smart; the conversions are useful when sending
		files to friends. The "flip" binary used to do these conversions was written
		by Craig Stuart Sapp. See http://ccrma-www.stanford.edu/~craig/utility/flip/ for details.

<li>		A script is included to call pdfselect and extract portions of pdf documents.
		A user could request one file containing pages 3 through 7 of the tex document, one 
		containing page 29, and one containing pages 31  through 36. The advantage of placing 
		this code in the Macros menu is that a user interface is provided, so users don't need to remember calling conventions for pdfselect and don't need to switch to the Terminal.

<li>	A #DOCUMENTNAME# variable was added to the Macro editor, giving applescript commands
	the name of the calling document.

<li>	The following applescript commands were added to
		TeXShop. Consult the TeXShop help files for details about writing your own scripts
		using these commands.
	<p>
		<ul>
			<li> typeset
			<li> latex		
			<li> tex		
			<li> bibtex		
			<li> context
			<li> metapost
			<li> makeindex
			<li> typesetinteractive
			<li> latexinteractive		
			<li> texinteractive		
			<li> bibtexinteractive		
			<li> contextinteractive
			<li> metapostinteractive
			<li> makeindexinteractive
			<li> typeset
			<li> refreshpdf
			<li> refreshtext 
			<li> taskdone
		</ul>
		<p>
<li>		Improved support was added for external editors, following prodding by Joachim Kock.
		Several changes have been made:

<ul>
<p><li>		     There is now a preference to turn on continuous updating of the
		     preview window if the user is running in external editor mode. Once each
		     second the program checks to see if the pdf file has been updated. If so,
		     it refreshes the pdf display. 

<p><li>		 The interval between refresh checks is controlled by a hidden preference item
			named RefreshTime. To reset to another interval
		     in seconds (say every 2.19 seconds)
		<p>	
			defaults write TeXShop RefreshTime 2.19
		<p>

<p><li>		      Applescript command support has been added to TeXShop so external
		     applications can send commands to it. For external editors, the important
		     script commands are
<p>
		<ul>
		<li>	latexinteractive	
		<li>	texinteractive	
		<li>	bibtexinteractive	
		<li>	contextinteractive
		<li>	metapostinteractive
		<li>	makeindexinteractive
		<li>	typesetinteractive
		<li>	refreshpdf
		<li>	taskdone
		<li>	open_for_externaleditor
		</ul>
<p>
		     The first seven commands call TeXShop's typesetting engine.  
			When one of these commands is called, control immediately returns
		     to the calling program even though the typesetting operation is not complete. The
		     taskdone command returns FALSE while this operation continues and TRUE when it
		     is done, so a calling program wishing to send several commands can send one
		     command and then test that it has been completed before sending another command.
<p><li>		  Refreshpdf updates the preview display, and can be used instead of
		     continuous updating to control that display. Typesetting commands automatically
		     update the display upon completion.

<p><li>		  The open_for_externaleditor command opens a .tex file, calling "Open for Preview..."
</ul>
<p>
<li>		Additional features not related to scripting or external editors have also been
		added:

			<li>		"Select All" can be used to select the full page of pdf output in selection mode.
					There is one restriction; in Multi-Page and Double-Multi-Page mode, select all is
					only active if the document has at most 20 pages, since otherwise the
					selected pdf will be enormous and bring the machine to a crawl.

		<li>		A preference item now allows users to distill with Apple's pstopdf rather than
					ghostscript. This only works in Panther because pstopdf is only in Panther.
					If the preference is chosen but Panther is not running, the old ghostscript code
					will be used. When the preference is chosen, ghostscript is no longer needed
					for internal TeXShop scripts, but it may still be required for teTeX style files.
					One such case is epstopdf.sty, used to automatically convert eps files to pdf
					format during typesetting.

			<li>		Zenitani provided additional drag and drop support. The new version reports
					an error if the filename of the dropped file contains a space. The new code also
					permits customization, in a somewhat strange way. To customize drag and drop
					code, add a new submenu to the Macros menu titled "Drag & Drop". Inside this
					folder, insert items for file types and make the text of each item be the code
					to be produced by drag and drop. For example, one item might be called ".pdf"
					and the body of this item might be "\includegraphics[#INS#]{%r}" where neither
					item would include the quotation marks. In these inclusions, 
					<p>
					<ul>
					<li>	%F = full path of an dropped file
					<li>	%f = dropped filename
					<li>	%r = relative path of the dropped file
					<li>	%n = filename without extension
					<li>	%e = extension
					</ul>
<p>
			<li>		If an extension is not listed in the Drag & Drop menu, or if there is no such menu,
					then drag and drop behaves as Zenitani proscribed, so most users won't need to
					customize the code.

li>		German help has been updated by Martin Kerz, the Italian localization has been
					updated by Nicola Vitacolonna, the Spanish help was updated by Juan Luis Varona
					Malumbres, the French localization was updated by Hendrik Chaltin, and a
					Romanian localization was added by Andrei Teleman. Thanks!

			<li>		Macros can now be called when the preview window is active; commands which
					insert text will be deactivated in this mode. A toolbar item for the Preview window
					was added so the Preview toolbar can display a Macros button.	
<li>		An "Abort" button was added to the console for people who want to stop the typesetting
		program in midstream. This is a minor change.

<li>		Code by Elliott Hughes was added to clean up some of the code calling a latex, tex, bibtex,
		etc., task. If the binary file is not found, the program now puts up an error message
		explaining the error and asking if the preferences bin path is correct. This will be useful
		for those running fink who forget to change the preference.

<li>		At the request of Joachim Kock, when TeXShop opens
		a file for Preview, or is in external editor mode and opens a file, the program now
		compares the dates of the source and preview files. If the preview file is not up to
		date or does not exist at all, the source file is automatically typeset.
		There is a hidden preference to turn this behavior off, but it is on by default:
		To turn it off
	<p>
			defaults write TeXShop ExternalEditorTypesetAtStart NO
<p>
</ul>


<p><font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial"> Bugs fixed:
</font>
		<ul>
<font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial">

				<li>		A few users reported that their printers added a slight yellow background to the page. Only a few printers had that problem. Frank Stengel discovered that it was caused
					by a NSEraseRect call in the print drawing routine. This call has been removed;
					now TeXShop prints using only one line, the vanilla Cocoa call
					[myRep draw].

			<li>		In Panther, all Text objects offer word completion. If a portion of a word is typed
					and option-escape is typed, the system will offer a list of possible completions.
					This works in TeXShop, TextEdit, and other Cocoa programs. But TeXShop's
					Command completion was broken in Panther, and made it impossible to use
					this new feature. This is fixed.

			<li>		TextShop has an applescript command to add text, but this command did not
					update the undo stack.
					This was fixed by Stefan Walsen; his patch is in version 1.33.
			
			<li>	If the user printed the source and later printed the typeset document, the document
					would be lowered on the page. This is fixed.

		<li>		Jerry Keough found a strange bug when using TeXShop in Jaguar. If the user's preference setting asked that no empty document appear at startup  and if the user opened a document, made the
					pdf window active, and then reached over and closed the source window, the next menu use would
					crash the program. This bug did not occur in Panther. It is fixed.


</font>
</ul>


<P><font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial"> Version 1.32 adds two extra features to TeXShop and fixes some bugs.
</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial"> New features:
</font>
<ul>
<li> <font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial">
There is a new menu item, "New Tag", which inserts an empty tag in the
					source text and positions the cursor so the user can add the name of the tag.
					As a corollary, there is now a keystroke to add a new tag; the keystroke
					is command-2.
</font>

<li> <font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial">
In Applescript macros, the terms #LOGPATH#, #AUXPATH#, #INDPATH#,
					#BBLPATH#, and #HTMLPATH# will now be recognized; this has been added
					at the request of Claus Gerhardt.
</font>

<li> <font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial">
There is a new option to set the program called by MetaPost. See the
					TeXShop help file for an explanation.
</font>

<li> <font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial">
The drag and drop code has been improved by Seiji Zenitani. Dropping
					files of types pdf, jpg, jpeg, tif, tiff, eps, or ps on the source document will
					produce \includegraphics and a reference to the file. Dropping a file of type
					cls, sty, or bib will \documentclass, \usepackage, or \bibliographystyle and
					a file reference. Dropping any other text file will produce \input and a file
					reference.
</font>

</ul>

<p><font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial"> Bugs fixed:
</font>
		<ul>
<font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial">
<li> Although the magnification level can increase to 1000 in version 1.31, 
					the arrow keys next to the magnification control only allowed values up to
					400. This is fixed.


<li> If the preview window's toolbar was in text-only mode and the magnification
					panel was selected, the resulting small dialog window would not go away
					in 1.31. This is fixed. 

<li> In Preferences, if the user set the tab size or the preview window magnification
					and then cancelled, the new values would still appear when the Preference
					panel was again displayed. This is fixed.

<li> Suppose the preference to place the first page on the right side is active.
					In 1.31, the left arrow key did now work in double page mode, and the right arrow
					key stopped one page before the end. In double multipage mode, the end
					key, the page down key, and the right arrow key stopped before displaying
					the last page. All of these problems are fixed.

</ul>


<P><font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial"> Version 1.31 adds some extra features to TeXShop and fixes several bugs.
</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial"> New features:
</font>
<ul>
<li> <font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial">
Macros items are now specific to the typesetting engine set in the current
window. Two default sets are created when TeXShop first starts, one for
Latex and one for Context. (The Context set was created by Hans Hagen;
thanks!). Suppose a different engine is selected, say TeX. When it
starts, it will have the default Latex macros. But if this set of Macros
is edited with the Macro editor, the new set will always be associated
with TeX, while the old Latex macros will continue to be associated
with Latex. Of course the Latex macros can also be changed.
</font>

<li> <font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial">
A new preference item allows the first page in the two double page modes
to be either on the left or on the right. Books usually put this page on
the right, so that is the default preference.
</font>

<li> <font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial">
The preference dialog has a new pulldown menu to reset preferences to
default values. This addition was requested by Seiji Zenitani for users in
Japan who must cope with three different versions of pTeX. These users can
now rapidly set preferences without consulting documentation on web sites.
</font>

<li> <font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial">
The largest possible magnification in the preview window is
now 1000 (previously it was 400).
</font>

<li> <font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial">
Additional French menu translations by Hendrik Chaltin; thanks!
</font>


</ul>
<p><font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial"> Bugs fixed:
</font>
		<ul>
<font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial">
<li> Three Panther problems are fixed. A few interface changes
were made to improve appearance in Panther. This
release is essential for Panther. 

<ul>
	<li> In Panther, older versions of TeXShop refuse to create
	new files, although they can open existing files. This was fixed 
	by adding two lines to the "displayName" code.

	<li> In Panther, the small yellow tags which display the current
	page when scrolling in multipage and double multipage display
	formats were blank. Also, the small yellow tags which display
	the size of a selection rectangle to copy
	a portion of the pdf window were blank. This is fixed.

	<li> On my system, Panther spellchecking often fails for all
	programs. This happens at boot time. The computer boots
	up, but even if the first program used is TextEdit or Mail, it refuses
	to "spell check as you type" and the "Spelling dialog" refuses
	to appear. I suspect this is due to a defective third party program on my
	disk, since other Panther users haven't seen the problem. But
	I haven't been able to isolate the bug. Once the problem occurs, TextEdit and Mail have minor text
	input glitches which are cured by turning off continuous spell
	checking. TeXShop had more serious glitches in this situation.
	So in 1.31, extra code has been added to turn off continuous
	spell checking when TeXShop starts if the spell checker is not
	available.

	</ul>

<li> Fixed a bug reported by Luis Sequeira: when text was dragged within
the source window, it was always copied and pasted. It should have been cut and
pasted unless the option key was down. This is fixed. 

<li> Juan Luis Varona Malumbres slightly improved Spanish help (small
icon for the list of help files in the drawer).

<li> In two page mode, typesetting no longer scrolls to the first
page.

<li> The new page and magnification buttons retain firstResponder
status (as before 1.29) so users can experiment with several
settings without clicking again for each experiment.

<li> In version 1.30 and before, if the user input an impossible line 
into the "Go To Line" dialog, the program could crash; this is fixed. 
Thanks to Eric Seidel for the bug report.

<li> Kevin Ballard, kevin@sb.org, contributed a new English.lproj folder
with revised placement of interface items in preferences, slightly revised
menu items, and other changes to improve the look of the interface
in Panther. Many thanks!

<li> Made spacing changes for Panther in the German preference panel.
Thanks to Martin Kerz for the suggestions.

<li> There is a hidden preference item to turn off tag computation:
"defaults write TeXShop TagSections NO" but this preference was disabled
somewhere along the line and certainly in 1.30. It is enabled again.
<font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial">

<li> The Preference window is no longer hidden when the program is
deactivated.

</ul>
