		<P><font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial">To use TeXShop, type your LaTeX input in the editing window it provides. Then push the &quot;Typeset&quot; button at the top of the window. The input will be saved and pdflatex will run. A second window will open displaying messages from tex. If there are errors, pdflatex will halt; type &quot;return&quot; to skip the errors one by one, or one of the standard TeX inputs to quit, run continuously, etc. After the document has been typeset, a new window will appear showing the resulting pdf file. You can switch between the two windows by typing command-1.</font></P>
		<p><font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial">Press the mouse on a section of the pdf output display to magnify the region near the cursor. Double click to magnify a larger region; triple click to magnify a still larger region. Notice that the default region size can be selected using
an element of the toolbar at the top of the page. </font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial">To typeset a TeX document, push the button labeled LaTeX and select TeX instead of LaTeX. If you usually use TeX, choose it as your default program in the Preferences Dialog.</font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial">If you notice an error, you can immediately fix it in the editing window and push the &quot;Typeset&quot; button again without halting the first invocation of pdflatex. The program will kill that invocation and run another. </font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial">TeXShop remembers the source lines of the first twenty errors. To cycle through these lines in the source file, choose &quot;Go To Error&quot; in the Edit menu or type the keyboard shortcut for this menu item.</font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial">When you fix errors and typeset again, the viewer will remember the page you were previously viewing.</font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial">If a line in the source begins with the characters &quot;%:&quot;, TeXShop interprets the remaining word or words on the line as a &quot;tag&quot; and adds these words to the Tag pulldown menu. Choosing a tag entry in this menu will scroll to the appropriate line in the source file. Lines which begin with the words \section, \subsection, \subsubsection, or \chapter are automatically added to the Tag menu. However, this behavior can be changed by typing the following command in Apple's Terminal program:</font></p>
		<dl>
			<dd><font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial"><tt>defaults write TeXShop TagSections NO</tt></font>
		</dl>
		<p><font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial">TeXShop can show multiple documents. If you choose &quot;New&quot; or &quot;Open,&quot;  your original document will remain and additional windows for the new document will open. If you open a TeX file in a folder which contains a pdf file with the same name, this pdf will also appear.</font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial">Some users like to divide their source into multiple files controlled by a master file using an \input command. TeXShop always saves the source file before typesetting. If the preference item &quot;During File Save, Save Related Files&quot; is checked, the master file will be searched before typesetting and any input file open in TeXShop will also be saved. This feature is due to John Nairn.</font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial">You can start TeXShop by double clicking on a document with extension &quot;.tex&quot;. The program will open that input document and (if it exists) the associated pdf document.</font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial">You can close the pdf window at any time. It will reappear when the document is typeset again. If you close the input window then both the input and output windows will close (windows from other TeX documents will remain open). Therefore, if an input source window is cluttering the screen, hide it instead of closing it.</font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial">pdftex and pdflatex are unix programs derived from Knuth's TeX program. The syntax of TeX does not allow spaces in filenames, so source files created with TeXShop should be given names without spaces. TeXShop itself has no problem with spaces in filenames.</font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial">
	The preview window's behavior can be changed using the "Magnification" and "Display Format" items in the Preview menu. For example, you can configure the scroller to scroll through all of the document pages; the preview window can show two pages at a time; resizing the window can be made to change the preview magnification. Experiment until you find the mode you prefer, and then select this mode in preferences to make it permanent.
