LilyPond engines for TeXShop by Nicola Vitacolonna

The engines should work out of the box, provided that you have LilyPond.app
installed in /Applications. If LilyPond.app is in a different folder, edit
LilyPond-Book.engine and set the $LILYPONDFOLDER variable accordingly. Then,
edit LilyPond.engine and convert-ly.engine and set the LILYPONDFOLDER variable
accordingly.

When using LilyPond-Book.engine to typeset a multi-source document (a TeX
document that includes external source files, e.g., with \input), make sure that
the suffix of all your TeX source files is .lytex rather than .tex (only the
root document may have suffix .tex), otherwise compilation will fail. See
LilyPondBookMoreFiles in the Examples folder.

LilyPond-Book.engine puts the many intermediate files generated by LilyPond into
two subfolders named <jobname>-lily and <jobname>-out, where <jobname> is the
name of your source file. It is safe to remove those folders at any time: they
will be re-created at the next run.
