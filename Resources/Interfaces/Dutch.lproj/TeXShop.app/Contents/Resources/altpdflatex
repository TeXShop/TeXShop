# This script assumes that there is a config.pdf somewhere that sets
# the bitmap mode to something large but realistic (real mode) so that
# unavailable pfb fonts will be included as bitmaps.

# Version 1.0:	added the string above for identification purposes
# Version 1.0a:	Cosmetic change: do not display dir of argv[0] all the time
#		Added calledas variable to hold command basename
# Version 1.1:	Use calledas instead of $0 which means the sed command
#		for determining format below also works when there is no dir
#		(run from dir where altpdftex resides, not very likely...)
# Version 1.2:	Force the use of tex binaries from the same directory as
#		this script
# Version 1.3:  Added --echo-version option, placed argument check after
#		switch, inside while to prevent subscript out of range error
#		Added --tex-path to override directory where this script
#		resides. Added --gs-path to override a new default gs
#		directory /usr/local/bin. Also, force gs directory at the
#		start of the path to repair for broken installations of
#		TeX, gs and such
# Version 1.4:	Moved path changes to just before calling gs so that only
#		ps2pdf is affected
# Version 1.5:	Removed some path-related redundancy from GS calling
# Version 1.5a:	Missing ${extradviopts} from echo
#		Added version to --help output
#		Added wolfram.map
# Version 1.6:	Fixed bug: --dviopts did not work because it did set
#		the wrong variable
#		Changed dviopts to dvipsopts (better name)
# Version 1.7:	Added --distiller and --distiller-filter option
#		Changed --gs-path to --distiller-path
#		Changed distiller semantics
#		Fixed bug --tex-path flag needed trailing '/'
#		Some extra quoting to be more robust for whitespace
#		in names, also internally
# Version 1.8:	Added pstill and u-psbuild info to help
# Version 1.9:	Removed textrace bbold font (textrace is broken)
# Version 1.10:	Added amstex support
#		Simplified different format support
# Version 1.11:	Do not source ~/.{t}cshrc, use the environment 'as is'
#		Version 1.11 says it is version 1.10!
# Version 1.12: Added textrace bold font (textrace 0.48 is ok)
# Version 1.13:	Changed success message at the end
#		Echo version on by default
#		Debug option
# Version 1.13b:Date report on version was very out of date, removed

# Version 2.0:	Rewritten in /bin/sh because (t)csh does not handle signals
#		very well...
#		This version works, but you need to send the SIGTERM to
#		the process group (the negative PID) to get it to work
# Version 2.1:	Small bug fixes
# Version 2.2:	Fixed bug where argument without extension was interpreted
#		as dvi file.
#		Removed dependencies on smart sh versions
# Version 2.3:	Removed map file knowledge (needs to be outside this script)
#		beyond the standard map files
# Version 2.4:	Added support for omega and lambda (use odvips)
# Version 2.5:	Changed maxpk and maxpfb implementation to recent updmap
# Version 2.6:	Use ps2pdf13 as the default distiller
# Version 2.7:	Changed help
# Version 2.8:	Checked into CVS.
#		Added handling of outdir for TeX
# Version 2.9:	Added auto-outdir flag
# Version 2.10:	Changed --outdir behaviour to mimick TEXMFOUTPUT,
#		removed --auto-outdir
# Version 2.11:	Fixed typo
# Version 2.12:	RCS changes, from now on, the version number is the RCS number
#		These notes here will become a ChangeLog.
# 2003/05/20	Joachim's modification: write first to a pdf file in tmp, 
#		and only upon completion copy the file to its final
#		destination.  This is done in order to minimise the time where
#		the pdf file in current directory is in an unstable state,
#		because a PDF viewer might be tracking the file, and 
#		if it finds the pdf file in an intermediate state it will
#		display a blank page until the new version is ready.
# 2003/05/21	Joachim's modification used /bin/cp. Gerben made it truly
#		atomic by using /bin/cp in combination with /bin/mv

# FEATURE: it seems -u +foo.map -u -foo.map does not work. So --extradvipsopts
# cannot be used to remove a map from the standard list

# BUG: Handling of file name extensions is not completely equialent to TeX
# i.e. foo.bar.bla gets you foo.bar.pdf not foo.bar.bla.pdf
# Give all extensions

This is altpdftex, $version

Usage: ${calledas}
	[--dvipsopts dvipsoptstring] [--extradvipsopts dvipsoptstring] [--pdf]
	[--default] [--maxpk] [--maxpfb] [--extendedname] [--no-echo-version]
	[--tex-path dir] [--keep-psfile] [--distiller-path dir] [--debug]
	[--distiller prog] [--distiller-filter prog] [--help]
	[--outdir dir] tex-or-dvi-file

${calledas} is a way to do pdf{e}{la}tex without having pdf{e}{la}tex. It needs a
working TeX environment and ghostscript. Since pdf{e}{la}tex cannot handle
insertion of .eps graphics, ${calledas} gives an alternative. The output for both
systems is comparable.

${calledas} compiles the file with {LA}TeX, processes the DVI file with dvips into
PostScript and uses gs to produce pdf (with ps2pdf). There is finegrained
control over the resulting filename and the options with which dvips produces
the PostScript intermediary file.

Dvips will call Metafont to produce bitmaps or include PostScript .pfb files
depending on the flags. See below.

Default settings is normal name, maximal use of pfb's, just like pdf{la}tex,
in other words, "pdftex file.tex" and "altpdftex file.tex" both produce an
output file file.pdf. For pdftex, output options are controlled by pdftex.cfg,
for altpdftext by config.ps (unless --pdf is given).

Arguments:
	tex-or-dvi-file
		If a .dvi file is given, skip the TeX process. Otherwise, TeX
		the input file, dvips the resulting dvi file and ps2pdf the
		resulting ps file
	--help
		Display this message and exit
	--no-echo-version
		Do not echo location and version of this script. Does not exit
		so can be used tochange info to the output of a real run
	--debug
		Add some debug output
	--extendedname
		Depending on the mode, adds intermediary extensions to the
		output filename. If the mode is --pdf, .pdfmode is added. If
		the mode is --maxpk, ,maxpk is added and if the mode is
		--maxpfb, .maxpfb is added. Example:
			tex-or-dvi-file-basename.maxpfb.pdf
	--maxpk
		Use Metafont bitmaps (pk files) when possible. Only real
		PostScript fonts (like Times Roman) are included as
		PostScript fonts. All other fonts are included as bitmaps
		for the default printer resolution. This options produces
		optimal results for the chosen printer.
		For file contents (not name) equivalent to:
		--dvipsopts "-Ppk"
	--maxpfb
		Use PostScript pfb files whenever possible. This produces
		optimal results for the screen.
		For file contents (not name) equivalent to:
		--dvipsopts "-Poutline"
		If any font is included as TeX pk bitmap, it is rendered
		at the default resolution.
	--pdf
		Select .pdfmode extension for the output file name if
		--extendedname has been set. Use printer definition
		config.pdf. For file contents (not name) equivalent to
		--dvipsopts "-Ppdf"
		Note that the default config.pdf assumes resolution 8000
		for bitmaps and bitmap generation fails at this resolution
		because there exists no known mode for that resolution.
	--default
		Select no extension for the output file name, even if
		--extendedfilename has been set. Use standard printer
		definition config.ps. For file contents (not name) equivalent
		to:
		--dvipsopts "" --noextendedname
	--dvipsopts
		Give arbitrary arguments to dvips, e.g.
		--dvipsopts "-M"
		Sets extension for --extendedfilename to .custom. --dvipsopts
		overrides other flags that set dvipsopts.
	--extradvipsopts
		Give extra arbitrary arguments to dvips, e.g.
		--extradvipsopts "-M"
		Sets extra options for dvips and does not set extension
		or override other options. Options will be added to the end
		of the options for dvips
	--keep-psfile
		After running dvips, copy the ps file over to the directory
		where the tex file is, possibly overwriting a ps file
		that is there. Use with caution, a ps file could be input
		as well.
	--tex-path
		Give path of TeX binaries, use directory of this script
		otherwise
	--distiller prog
		Use a distiller different from ps2pdf which is the default.
		Argument must be an executable or executable script that
		gets called iwth two arguments: input file (PS) and output
		file (PDF). E.g.:
		--distiller=/usr/local/alternate/bin/ps2pdf
		--distiller=pstill
		Using this flag sets the distiller filter mode to off
	--distiller-filter prog
		Use a distiller executable or executable script which is
		called with the PS input as standard input and which writes
		the PDF output to standard output. E.g.:
		--distiller-filter=u-psbuild
	--distiller-path
		Give path needed by the distiller binary. This path is added
		to the begin of you PATH environment before the distiller is
		run. The reason is that for instance ps2pdf uses the path to
		find gs and sets the path to something with /sw/bin at the
		beginning.  Thus, installing gs from fink would make
		/usr/local/bin/ps2pdf find another gs than intended. By giving
		an empty path, the path is not changed before the distiller
		program is run. The default is empty.
	--outdir dir
		Write files here *if* our current directory is unwritable. This
		mimicks the TEXMFOUTPUT environment variable of TeX, but
		differently. The current dir becomes the value of --outdir and
		the directory where the old current dir is added to TEXINPUTS.
		This is more robust for reading and locating files.
		You can also set TEXMFOUTPUT instead, but with a disadvantage:
		you will be running TeXin the current dir. And you will not be
		able to read files in the outdir unless you also adapt
		TEXINPUTS.

	The defaults for the distiller are
		Path addition: "${distillerpath}"
		Filter mode: "${distillerfilter}"
		Program: "${distillerprog}"

	Later flags override settings of earlier flags.
