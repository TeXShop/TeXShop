		<P>
		This page contains miscellaneous useful commands which have not yet found their natural place in the help system.
		
	<ul>
	<p>
	<li> The preview window toolbar contains a search field. If this window is active, 
	the keyboard shortcut Command-F will move the cursor to the field for immediate entry
	of a search phrase.
	
	<p> After the phrase is typed, push RETURN to go to the first occurrence of the phrase in the document. This will also make the main pdfView the first responder, so the selection will be visible in blue. Type command-G to go to the next occurrence, and shift-command-G for a backward search. This is parallel to the corresponding commands for text searches. (Previously, RETURN and SHIFT-RETURN
	performed these commands, but these require that the search field be the first responder and thus product selections in gray instead of blue.)
		
	<p> Suppose you want to search on page 63. Go to that page and select any section of text
	with at least one letter. After that, searches will begin from that selection.
	
	<p> Click in the PDF file to create an empty selection. Then searches will again begin at the start of the document.
	
	<p> If a search reaches the end of the document, it will cycle to start at the beginning.


	<li>
	<p> A user complained that his collaborators in Europe insert non-ascii characters into the source document, and asked for a search command which would locate all such characters so they could be edited out. This feature is already present in TeXShop.
	
	<p> Select the OgreKit Find Panel using TeXShop Preferences. This panel has powerful features and is activated by most TeXShop users. In particular, it can handle regular expressions.
	
	<p> Search for 
	<dd>
	<dl> [^[:ascii:]]
	</dd> 
	
	Click the "Regular Expressions" option.
	
	<p> Click "Next" to search for  occurrences one by one, or push the "Highlight" button
	to highlight all non-ascii characters at once. 
	
	<p> Similar tricks are possible using other regular expressions. Read about regular expressions on the internet and experiment.
	
	<li>
	<p> TeXShop  has a hidden preference setting to control the "ColorIndex" tool. Type the following command in Terminal to turn this item on by default for each new document:
	<dd>
	<dl> defaults write TeXShop IndexColorStart YES 
	</dd>
	
	<li>
	<p> When either magnifying glass is being used, temporarily pushing the Command, Option, or Control keys will increase the amount of magnification, and temporarily pushing Shift-Command, Shift-Option, Shift-Control will decrease the magnification. 
	
	<li>
	<p> The LaTeX hyperref package adds active links and url's to pdf documents. Many are under author control, but the package automatically links table of contents items to the starts of chapters and sections, and automatically links reference items to the corresponding bibliography entry.
	
	<p> TeXShop  makes it easy to understand these links at a glance. If the mouse hovers over a link, a popup window appears for several seconds showing the linked portion of the document. This is particularly useful when checking references in the document.
	
	<p> Normally the popup window is on the screen for four seconds and then disappears. If the option key is down when these four seconds are up, the popup window will remain on the screen until the mouse moves.
	
	</ul>
