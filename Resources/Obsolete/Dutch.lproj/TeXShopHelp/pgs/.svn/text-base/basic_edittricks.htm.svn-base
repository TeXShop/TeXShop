<p> Double clicking on a bracket of the form (, {, [, ], }, or ) will select everything between that bracket and its matching bracket. Double clicking on a bracket with the option key down will select the bracket alone.</p>
<p> TeXShop has a new Find panel by Isao Sonobe. This panel supports regular expressions. Users can switch
between this panel and the original one in Preferences. The Find panel depends on OgreKit, a Cocoa framework
for handling regular expressions by Sonobe. See</p>

</dl>

<p> OgreKit is distributed using a slightly modified version of the BSD license; this license can be found
in the TeXShop source code distribution. OgreKit requires Panther, so the new panel will only appear on
machines running system 10.3 or later.</p>
<p> There are many nice features of this new Find panel. OgreKit modifies the "Find" submenu of the TeXShop
edit menu, replacing it with a more extensive menu. The Find panel presents buttons controlling how it will
find words; the settings of these buttons will be remembered from session to session. Adjust them
until Find words as expected and then relax.</p>

		<P>Groups of lines can be commented out using a menu command, and later activated again. Groups of lines can be indented with a menu command, and later moved back. If a line starts with a series of tabs or spaces, new lines will start at the same position until the behavior is cancelled by backspacing. This behavior was added to TeXShop by Nicol&aacute;s Ojeda B&auml;r in Argentina, who can be reached at <a href="mailto:lojedaortiz@interlink.com.ar">lojedaortiz@interlink.com.ar</a>. Thanks!</P>

<P>
The source window can be split in two pieces using the split tool at the top of the window. When it is split, two views of the same source are
shown. You can type in either piece and your changes will immediately appear in the other as well. Thus you can modify one section of
source while reading a second part of the source.
</P>

<P>
TeXShop can be instructed to create a backup file every time a file is saved or typeset. This is set using a hidden preference.
To create backup files, open Terminal and type the following command:
</P>
		<dl>
			<dd><tt>defaults write TeXShop SaveBackup YES</tt>
		</dl>
<P> Change YES to NO to stop creating backups.
</P>

<p> A Statistics panel lists the number of words, line, and characters in a document. Internally, this
panel calls</p>
<dl>
<dd> detex myfile | wc
</dl>
<p> The detex command removes tex commands, but the word count is still only approximate. Input and
include files are counted automatically by this command.</p>

<P>
File icons can be dragged and dropped onto the source text. If the file is a tex file, an \input command will be
added with a relative path to the file. If the file is a graphic file, an \includegraphics command will be
added instead. The following graphic types are recognized: pdf, jpg, jpeg, tif, tiff, eps, ps.
</P>

<P>
Dropping a cls file produces \documentclass and a file reference, dropping a sty file produces
\usepackage, dropping a bib file produces \bibliographystyle, and dropping other text files
produces \input.
</P>

<p> Drag and drop resolves aliases. For example, if a graphic file is really an alias, the file can
be drag-and-dropped to the source and this source will typeset fine. TeX itself cannot resolve aliases,
although it can resolve symbolic links. So if the name of the graphic alias is typed directly into
the source, it will cause an error during typesetting.</p>

<P>
The behavior of drag and drop is user customizable. Customization is done with the Macro menu. Insert a new submenu
titled "Drag & Drop". Inside this submenu place items named with the extension whose behavior
you wish to customize, and place the code that should be inserted in the body of this item.
For instance, if the item is .pdf, the code might be \includegraphics[#INS#]{%r}. In these inclusions,
the following abbreviations may be used:

<dl>
<dd>	%F full path of an dropped file
<dd>	%f dropped filename
<dd>	%r relative path of the dropped file
<dd>	%n filename without extension
<dd>	%e extension.
</dl>
</P>

<P>
If an extension is not mentioned in the Macro Editor, then it is
handled in the default manner mentioned earlier. Thus for
most people, no macro "Drag & Drop" submenu is needed.
