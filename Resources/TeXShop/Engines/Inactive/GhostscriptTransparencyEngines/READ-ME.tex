These engines are by Herbert Schulz, working with Bruno Voisin.

Recent versions of Ghostscript need an extra argument to enable transparency for pstricks
and processing by latex->dvips->ps2pdf or xelatex. Enclosed are four engines 
(latexTR.engine, latexTRmk.engine, xelatexTR.engine and xelatexTRmk.engine) 
and two special rc file for the `mk' engines. Instructions about where to place the 
three files are enclosed. 

Note: The xelatex based engines need TeX Live 2021 (e.g., installed by MacTeX-2021) to run properly.
