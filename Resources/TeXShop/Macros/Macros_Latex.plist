-- "INSERT REFERENCE"
-- This script searches through the current file (or within every file in the current folder) for \label{...} commands, then pops up a list for you to choose from which you may insert one.
--The inserted reference label is wrapped in a (optional) customisable LaTeX command.
-- It will cut down the list to include only those entries that contain the current selection. So if you type "sec" and select it, then run this script, you will get a choice of only, e.g., "sec:intro","sec:conc","fig:secunia", but not other labels in your document e.g., "cha:monkey","equ:maxwell",etc.

-- The companion script setfonts allows you to choose a font set from that file.
-- Font set commands are delimited by %SetFonts lines.
-- In none are found, the script fails.
-- If you add DELETE after the first %SetFonts (same line), SaveFontSet deletes the item.
-- The line following the first %SetFonts must be %&lt;title&gt;, where &lt;title&gt; is the ID for the set..
-- If you add DEFAULT after the first %SetFonts (same line), 
-- SaveFontSet makes it the default selection when using setfonts.
