-- "INSERT REFERENCE"
-- This script searches through the current file (or within every file in the current folder) for \label{...} commands, then pops up a list for you to choose from which you may insert one.
--The inserted reference label is wrapped in a (optional) customisable LaTeX command.
-- It will cut down the list to include only those entries that contain the current selection. So if you type "sec" and select it, then run this script, you will get a choice of only, e.g., "sec:intro","sec:conc","fig:secunia", but not other labels in your document e.g., "cha:monkey","equ:maxwell",etc.
