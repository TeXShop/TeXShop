	 Advanced users can replace TeXShop's default keyboard menu shortcuts with their
	 own customized versions using this file. This file must be named "KeyEquivalents.plsit"
          and live in the folder ~/Library/TeXShop/Menus.
          
          However, there are some substantial gotchas. The OgreKit Find menu items are controlled
          by Ogrekit and cannot be modified with this file. The Macro menu items are
          controlled by the Macro code and similarly cannot be modified here, although they
          can be modified using TeXShop's Macro Editor. Finally, several items in
          the File menu are controlled by Cocoa, and attempts to modify them yield unexpected
          results. 
          
	The structure of this file is as follows. At the top level, we list the items
	in the main TeXShop menu: TeXShop, File, Edit, Source, etc. We need only list
	menus containing items whose key equivalents we want to change. Below each
	top level menu is a dictionary containing items in this menu whose key equivalents
	are to be changed. Again, we need only list items to be changed. 
	
	Each dictionary entry has a key describing the menu item, and an array describing the
	new key equivalent. The first item in this array is a string giving the new key equivalent.
	This string should be an upper case or lower case character. For instance, it could 
	be "C" or "c". On the menu display, it will be capitalized,  and an extra shift character 
	will appear for capitol letters. The string could also be an empty string  <string></string>.
	In that case, any existing key equivalent will be removed.
	
	The next array element is "true" if the option key should be down and "false" otherwise. 
	The final array element is "true" if the control key should be down and "false" otherwise. 
		
	If an item is a submenu, then the item is followed by a dictionary listing
	the items in the submenu rather than an array. The elements in this dictionary 
	describe the submenu items. TeXShop submenus of depth greater than one are rare and
	it isn't possible to change keyboard shortcuts for these items.

	In this file, menu items can be identified by a string containing the menu contents,
	or by a string with an integer listing the menu location. For example, the "Open" item
	in the "File" menu can be identified as <key>Open</key> or as <key>6</key>. Notice that
	the first item in a menu is numbered "1" rather than "0". Similarly the main
	menus across the top of the screen can be listed by name or number. The Apple menu does
	not count, so "TeXShop" is <key>TeXShop</key> or <key>1</key>, "File" is <key>File</key> 
	or <key>2</key>, etc.

	The advantage of names is that they are easier to read. However, the names refer to
	whatever localized version is running when the program starts, so if TeXShop has
	modified menu key equivalents in German, these equivalents will not remain when
	it is run in English.

	The advantage of numbers is that the configuration then works in all languages.
	However, if a new version of TeXShop appears with menu items in different locations,
	this file will need to be modified.

	If a key command is added to a menu item but it is already being used elsewhere, the
	command will not "take." In that case, the other command must be removed or changed.
        
	Below is an example to show how this works. The example implements a crazy redefinition:
	the key equivalent W is removed from the Close menu, and Comment, Uncomment, Indent,
	and Unindent items are assigned X, Y, Z, W with various combinations of option and
	control keys. Since nobody would actually want to do this, the example is commented out;
	use it as a guide and add similar definitions which are not bracketed inside the
	comment symbols.
