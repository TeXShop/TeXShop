# makeindices
# Claus Gerhardt
#
# This script will produce two indices for  file.tex. Use it by calling
# makeindices file (without the suffix)
# The two .idx files should have the suffixes .idx (for the standard index) and
# .sidx (for the index "List of symbols")
# This script will work even when just the standard .idx file is present
# and will then produce only file.ind
# It can easily be modifed for multiple indices with user defined suffixes.
# The option -g is required if one uses the babel package with the language german,
# otherwise, simple remove the "g". On the other hand I don't know of any 
# negative  effect by using the option -g with other languages - only the ordering 
# might be slightly effected.
# If more then one index is to be produced one has to use the package
# index.sty. For more more information consult
# http://www.math.uni-heidelberg.de/studinfo/gerhardt/cgmakeindex.tar.gz
