		<P><font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial">TeXShop can be configured for an external editor. There is a menu item named &quot;Open for Preview...&quot; When this item is chosen, you will be asked to select a tex source file. But only the associated pdf preview window opens (if the source has not yet been typeset, this preview window will be blank). Thanks to Leuski's toolbars, the preview window can be configured to contain a typesetting button. You can open your source file in any editor. When it is time to typeset, save the changes in your editor, switch to the preview window, and typeset. In this mode, TeXShop will never open or modify the source file. It will simply pass this file to the Unix TeX or LaTeX process.</font></P>
		<p><font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial">For users who prefer external editors most of the time, there is a preference item called &quot;Configure for External Editor.&quot; When this preference is chosen, the &quot;Open&quot; and &quot;Open Recent...&quot; menus open tex source files in the above manner for editing with an external editor. Moreover, the  &quot;Open for Preview...&quot; menu becomes &quot;Open for Editing...&quot; and opens the source file in TeXShop's internal editor for those rare occasions when the internal editor is desired. The &quot;Open&quot; and &quot;Open Recent...&quot; menus can also open jpg, tiff, ps, pdf, dvi, log, and other files; selecting the new preference does not change this behavior.</font></p>
		<p><font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial">Applescript support for the &quot;external editor option&quot; is still weak; it will improve in a future version, making it possible to typeset entirely from within an applescript-capable editor.</font></p>
