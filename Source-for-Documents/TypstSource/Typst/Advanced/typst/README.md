# Typst Templates
Here, you can find the five templates that currently ship with the [Typst web
app.](https://typst.app)

This is only a temporary home for them until there is a proper template package
manager for Typst.

Modifications by J$ <js@gumby.nl> to make them work as packages, importable
from a shared package directory, cf. <https://github.com/typst/packages#local-packages>.

Copy this directory (`typst`) to:
- `$HOME/Library/Application Support/typst/packages` on macOS
- `$XDG_DATA_HOME` or `~/.local/share` on Linux
