// This code comes directly from Apple's sample code "RoundTransparentWindow" Here is their heading:

/*
File:		CustomWindow.h

Description: 	This is the header file for the CustomWindow class, which is our subclass of NSWindow.  We need to subclass
		NSWindow in order to configure the window properly in -initWithContentRect:styleMask:backing:defer:
		to have a custom shape and be transparent.
