\fs24 \cf0 Version 1.0d1	Released July 23, 2000\
\
\
\pard\tx1440\tx2180\tx2800\tx4320\tx5760\tx7200\li1480\fi-20\ql\qnatural
\cf0 Version 1.0d2	Released August 31, 2000\
\
	Bugs Fixed:\
\
		In 1.0d1, if a character with ascii code larger than 127 was\
		added to a source file, the file could not be saved. 		Suppose a user opened the file ``try.tex'', typed additional\
		material, and inadvertently held down the option key while \
		typing a character. When the new version was typeset, the \
		system reported that ``try.tex'' no longer existed. In fact,\
		the old ``try.tex'' had been renamed ``try~.tex'' and additions\
		had not been saved. Fixed in 1.0d2, thanks to a detailed bug\
		report from Geoff Leyland.\
\
\
Version 1.0d3	Releasted October 7, 2000\
\
	This release is for the Public Beta release of OS X.\
\
	Bugs Fixed:\
\
		The public beta of OS X introduced the following bug: pushing \
		the Tex or  Latex button for the first time would save the file, \
		but not typeset it. This is due to a change made by Apple in the\
		NSDocument class. Fixed in this version.\
\
	New Feature:\
\
		The NSPDFImageRep class is not complete in the public\
		beta. It does not use embedded fonts or display embedded pdf \
		graphics. This version of TexShop has a preference item which\
		allows users to image pdf files using ghostscript rather than Apple's\
		pdf class. Ghostscript does use Tex fonts, and it shows embedded\
		jpg, but not pdf, images. (Note: I later discovered that my\
		ghostscript did not show pdf images because it was missing\
		the "fonts" folder. This is now fixed.)\
\
		This version still uses the Apple NSPDFImageRep class to\
		print, so documents with symbols or graphics will not print\
		correctly. A temporary workaround is to write the\
		document with TexShop and then open the pdftex output a\
		final time in Adobe Acrobat running under Classic and print \
		from that program. Another workaround is to typeset a final \
		time using the terminal program and tex or latex, and print the\
		dvi output file using dvips. \
\
\
Version 1.0d4	Released November 4, 2000\
\
	Bugs Fixed:\
\
		Previous versions saved tex source as 7-bit ascii code.\
		This version saves tex source as 8-bit ascii code. European \
		users requested this change because they use packages\
		which permit typing accented characters directly.\
		Such users should add the line\
\
			 \\usepackage[applemac]\{inputenc\}\
\
		to their source so pdflatex will correctly interprete the 8-bit\
		characters.\
\
	Additional Features:\
\
		Changed the name from TexShop to TeXShop, at the request of a\
		few folks.\
\
		Added tick marks to the magnification slider, and restricted its values\
		in ghostscript mode.\
\
		Allowed the program to open most files, not just files with extension\
		.tex. This makes it possible to examine log files, bib files,\
		etc. If a file's extension is not ".tex" or ".TEX", typesetting is\
		disabled. TeXShop can read files with many text formats, but always\
		writes them out as 8-bit ascii code, so it should not be used to\
		edit files which aren't related to tex.\
\
		Modified the interface; now there is only one typesetting\
		button. This was requested by a few users.\
\
		Added the ability to call Bibtex.\
\
		Changed the "goto line" command to make it select an entire line \
		so the selection is easily visible.\
\
		(November 18) Added the version of teTeX compiled in The \
		Netherlands for Mac OS X to my web page, and changed the help file\
		to refer to that version.\
\
\
Version 1.0d5	Released November 24, 2000\
\
	Additional Features:\
\
		Changed the help-file instructions to refer to versions of teTeX and \
		ghostscript compiled for MacOSX by Gerben Wierda. Wierda's version \
		of teTeX is built from the latest sources, is much easier to install, and \
		provides man pages. Thanks!\
\
		Added a French localization, constructed by Jerome Laurens. Thanks!\
\
		Added the ability to go directly to lines containing errors in the source.\
		TeXShop remembers the first twenty lines with errors. The command \
		Apple-E (and the equivalent menu command) brings up the source \
		window and cycles between these lines.\
\
\
Experimental Version	Released November 27, 2000\
\
	Additional Features:\
\
		Typing a \}, ), or ] briefly flashes the corresponding open parenthesis,\
		and double clicking on one of these symbols selects all text between\
		matching parentheses.\
\
		Added MakeIndex. \
\
\
Version 1.0d6	Released December 25, 2000\
\
	Additional Features:\
\
		Parenthesis matching and MakeIndex are now part of the official\
		release.\
\
		Opening graphic files (with extensions ".jpg", ".tiff", or ".pdf") displays\
		the graphics.\
\
		Added syntax coloring. This feature can be turned off in the\
		preferences menu.\
\
		Added tabs. A source line starting with the two characters "%:" is\
		interpreted as a tag and the remaining words on the line are entered\
		in the tag menu. Choosing a tag in this menu scrolls to the tag in\
		the source file.\
\
		Added a German localization by Keith J. Schultz.\
\
\
Version 1.0		Released March 24, 2001\
\
	Bugs Fixed:\
\
		The template command can now be undone.\
\
		Several syntax coloring bugs were fixed.\
\
		Parenthesis matching now works for left parentheses. Parenthesis\
		matching is snappier.\
\
	Additional Features:\
\
		Apple has fixed NSPDFImageRep! Consequently TeX fonts appear\
		in the output window and typeset documents can be printed directly\
		from TeXShop.\
\
		Apple has dramatically increased rendering speed.\
\
		The ghostscript option was removed because it is no longer needed.\
\
		TeXShop preferences are now saved using the Mac OS X "defaults\
		system." Because of this change, users must reset preferences the\
		first time the new version is run. The folder \
\
			~/Library/Preferences/TeXShop Prefs\
\
		created by the old version can be discarded.\
\
		Templates are now stored in ~/Library/TeXShop/Templates.\
\
		The magnification scroller at the bottom of the pdf page has been\
		replaced by a simple input box, giving more room for pdf text.\
\
		The template command can now be undone.\
\
		Several syntax coloring bugs were fixed.\
\
		Parenthesis matching now works for left parentheses. Parenthesis\
		matching is snappier.\
\
		The German localization is not complete because there wasn't\
		time to polish it before the release of OS X.\
\
\
Version 1.0 		April 7, 2001 \
\
		Without increasing the version number, I silently changed the\
		code on my web site:\
\
	Bugs Fixed: \
\
		Resizing the source window revealed strange words under the\
		buttons at the top.\
\
	Additional Features:\
\
		Added an Italian localization by Giuseppe Carlino.\
		\
\
Version 1.0 		April 29, 2001 \
\
		Without increasing the version number, I silently changed the\
		code on my web site:\
\
	Bugs Fixed:\
\
		The TeXShop menu now conforms to Mac OS X guidelines,\
		with menu commands to "Hide Others" and "Show All."\
\
		Control-1 now switches between the source window and the\
		associated pdf window.\
\
		Arrows appear beside the magnification box for rapid increases\
		and decreases in magnification. Thanks to Sven A. Schmidt for\
		suggesting this and sending code showing how it could be\
		done. \
\
		The tags menu uses a localized string and can be translated\
		into other languages.\
\
		A preference item allows users to configure the console window\
		so it only appears when there is a typesetting error. When\
		configured this way, the console is still visible behind other\
		windows and can be brought to the top with the Window menu.\
\
		Added a Dutch localization by Maarten Sneep.\
\
\
\
Version 1.1 		June 23, 2001 \
\
		At the suggestion of Sean Luke, added the option of typesetting\
		by using 
\f1\i tex
\f0\i0  or 
\f1\i latex
\f0\i0  to produce a dvi file, using 
\f1\i dvips
\f0\i0  to convert it\
		to a postscript file, and using 
\f1\i ps2pdf
\f0\i0  to convert this postscript to pdf.\
		The new option can process documents with included eps \
		illustrations without converting the illustrations to pdf.\
		Gerben Wierda constructed the final script, which is part of\
		his latest teTeX.\
\
		Changed preferences to interact with Gerben Wierda's new \
		compilation of teTeX; there is now a preference for the path to\
		teTeX binaries.\
\
	Bugs Fixed:\
\
		The previous version did not correctly indicate changes made to\
		tex source after saving to disk, so users could close the file without\
		being asked if they wanted to save changes. This is fixed.\
\
		The previous version did not allow users to save changes made to\
		any file except a tex source file. In particular, bibtex files could \
		not be saved. This is fixed.\
\
\
Version 1.11	July 6, 2001\
\
		Previous versions of TeXShop preserved vertical scroll position\
		in the output window when changing pages. The new version\
		scrolls, so the entire document can be read without using the\
		scroll bar by hitting "Next" over and over. The old behavior can\
		be chosen in Preferences.\
\
		After typesetting, users can select and copy messages from the  \
		console.\
\
		When TeXShop typesets using the TeX + Ghostscript option, it\
		constructs a temporary postscript file which is converted to\
		pdf format. A preference item has been added causing TeXShop\
		to retain this postscript file.\
\
		TeXShop files created by the new version have type "TEXT" so they \
		can be recognized by Carbon-based applications. This required \
		10 lines of Carbon code in an application which is otherwise \
		written in Cocoa.\
\
		A preference item allows users to decide whether TeXShop should\
		produce a blank page when it starts.\
\
\
Version 1.12	August 6, 2001\
\
		TeXShop can now open .dvi, .ps, and .eps files. Each is converted to\
		pdf format and the pdf file is saved and displayed. In particular,\
		.eps files are automatically converted to .pdf format when displayed.\
		The conversion process works for .eps files with unix line feeds 		or files with Macintosh line feeds. In particular, .eps files produced by\
		Mathematica will correctly convert to pdf format.\
\
		A major goal of this release of TeXShop and teTeX/ghostscript is to protect\
		the programs from X-windows software installed with fink. "Fink" is a program \
		available on the internet; it can be used to download X-windows software. \
		See http://fink.sourceforge.net. Fink installs programs in a new directory \
		named /sw/bin and adds this directory to the front of the PATH variable. \
		Consequently, if multiple copies of a program are available under MacOSX,\
		the fink version will be used.\
		     This causes trouble for TeXShop in two ways. First, fink provides\
		ghostscript 7 rather than ghostscript 6. But Apple's pdf drawing routines\
		have a bug and do not display fonts in pdf files created by ghostscript 7. \
		That is why the teTeX/ghostscript installer installs ghostscript 6. This bug\
		will eventually be fixed by Apple, but in the meantime TeXShop must call\
		ghostscript 6. \
		     Moreover, Fink provides a version of teTeX for use with lyx. This teTeX \
		is not configured in the same way as the teTeX provided with TeXShop.\
		It does not see user files installed in ~/Library/texmf, and does not contain \
		the altpdftex scripts. \
		     The new version of TeXShop protects against fink by calling the correct\
		versions of ghostscript and teTeX even if fink is installed. It will work with \
		previous copies of teTeX,  but for full protection, the new version of teTeX\
		should also be installed.\
		     If you install the fink version of teTeX, you should be aware that the\
		fink version will be used from the command line and the Gerben Wierda\
		version will be used from TeXShop. This is likely to be confusing. The Gerben \
		Wierda version should work fine with xdvi and other tools provided by fink,\
		so there is little reason to install the fink version of teTeX. \
\
		The new TeXShop has a way to save the typesetting method with each\
		source file so this method will be used regardless of preference or menu\
		settings. To make that happen, type one of the following as the first line\
		of the document.\
\
		%&tex, %&latex, %&pdftex, %&pdflatex, %&personaltex, %&personallatex\
\
		The first two commands select tex or latex + ghostscript, the second two\
 		select pdftex and pdflatex as configured in preferences, and the\
		final two select the personal script configured in preferences. \
			\
		Syntax coloring now colors the symbols $, \{, and \} dark green.\
		\
		The three syntax colors can be changed, although the preference\
		dialog does not contain entries for this change. Comment color\
		is controlled by "commentred, commentgreen, commentblue,"\
		command color is controlled by "commandred, commandgreen,\
		commandblue," and the color for "\{, \}, $" is controlled by "markerred,\
		markergreen, markerblue." The values of these variables are real\
		numbers between 0 and 1. For example, to make the marker colors\
		bright green, open a Terminal window and type the following\
		commands\
		\
		          defaults write TeXShop markerred 0.0\

\cf0 		          defaults write TeXShop markergreen 1.0\
		          defaults write TeXShop markerblue 0.0\
\
		It is now possible to add flags to the preference items for pdftex, pdflatex,		altpdftex, and altpdflatex.\

\cf0 		A bug with printing for projects with a project root has been fixed.\
\
		A few memory leaks were fixed. \
\
		\
Version 1.13	October 1, 2001\
\
		ConTeXt is a general purpose TeX macro package by Hans Hagen;\
		for some, it will be a serious alternative to Latex. See 		www.ntg.nl/context/ for details. A useful introduction can be found in\
		the document "LaTeX in proper ConTeXt" available at\
		http://berend.gameren.nl/tex/. TeXShop now supports ConTeXt. \
		The support in TeXShop 1.13 will improve in later versions. \
\
		MetaPost is a MetaFont like system by John Hobby which can output \
		postscript. This package can be used to draw elaborate postscript\
		illustrations.  See http://cm.bell-labs.com/who/hobby/MetaPost.html.\
		Interesting MetaPost examples can be found at many web sites;\
		for instance http://www.cs.ucc.ie/~dongen/mpost/mpost.html.\
		TeXShop now supports MetaPost. This support will improve in later\
		versions of the program.\
\
		TeXShop now has the ability to temporarily comment out sections of \
		source text, as suggested by Gary Gray. If text has been selected and the\
		menu item "Comment" is chosen, comment symbols will be added to the \
		first position of each line of selected text. Similarly if text if selected and  \
		the "Uncomment" menu command is selected, comment symbols will be\
		removed from the first position of each line of selected text.\
\
		TeXShop can indent sections of source text, using the comment\
		syntax just described.\
\
		TeXShop comes with a Spanish localization by Juan L. Varona. Thanks!\
\
	Bugs Fixed:\
\
		The English and Italian versions of the pdf window had the pdf\
		display too far to the left, cutting off the left margin and left scroll arrow.\
		This is fixed.\
\
		In previous versions, TeXShop could open pdf, eps, tif, dvi, and ps\
		files, but could not print these files. Now it can print them.\
\
		The magnify button only worked once in system 10.1; using it more than\
		once froze the display. This is fixed. \
\
		If the console window was hidden and bibtex was run on a file which\
		contained an error, then bringing the console window forward crashed TeXShop.\
		This is fixed.\
\
	Information:\
\
		After upgrading, you should be able to open a tex source file by double\
		clicking on the file. If that does not happen, select a tex source file in the\
		Finder and then choose the menu item "Show Info." In the pull-down menu\
		select "Open With Application."  In the top part of the resulting panel, click\
		the icon and navigate to the copy of TeXShop in /Applications. Choose\
		this copy and then push the "Change all" button at the bottom of the panel.\
\
		At this moment, the icon associated with the tex source file may vanish. If\
		that happens, log out and back in again and everything will be fine. \
\
\
Version 1.13b and 1.13c		December 12, 2002\
\
	Bugs Fixed:\
		\
		[GW] Fixed setting of path before running commands. Automatically creating \
		missing fonts now.\
		\
		[GW] Project root is now really relative\
\
		[GW] Script settings are now retrieved from the stored defaults\
\
\
Version 1.14		January 27, 2002\
\
		TeXShop now has a panel of common Latex symbols and commands;\
		clicking on a symbol in the panel inserts the corresponding text into the source\
		document. The panel can be displayed using an item in the Windows menu\
		or a corresponding key stroke.  This wonderful panel is entirely the work of \
		Geoffroy Lenglin, who just finished a masters degree in Aeronautics and \
		Astronautics at MIT.  Geoffroy can be reached at geoffroy.lenglin@m4x.org.\
\
		A few symbols in the panel require that appropriate packages by loaded\
		in the tex source file. For instance, the blackboard bold characters \
		require the line \\usepackage\{amssymb\}. This line is in the latest Latex\
		template, but the new template will not replace the old one if you already\
		use TeXShop. See a related remark below.\
\
		There is a special default, not exposed in the Preferences panel, which\
		slightly alters the appearance of the panel. Currently items are outlined\
		as the mouse passes over them. To remove this behavior, type the following\
		line in the Terminal application. Change NO to YES to revert to the default\
		behavior.\
\
			defaults write texshop LPanelOutlines NO\
\
		TeXShop can load and save files in Iso Latin format, using code\
		from Martin Heusse. This encoding can be chosen with a preference item; \
		the previous encoding, Mac OS Roman, remains the default. Iso Latin \
		encoding makes it possible to type accented characters directly into the\
		source file if certain packages are included with the tex source.  Thanks \
		also to Mats Weber for reinforcing the need for this change and providing \
		alternate coding.\
\
		The TeXShop editor remembers tab indents. If a line starts with\
		several tabs, the following lines will also start with these tabs until\
		they are canceled. This change is entirely due to Nicol\'87s Ojeda B\'8ar in\
		Argentina, whose email address is lojedaortiz@interlink.com.ar. Ojeda B\'8ar sent\
		two short, elegant procedures which were simply plugged in to the \
		TeXShop code. Ojeda B\'8ar writes that he is just finishing high school. \
		He has a bright programming future! Thanks.\
\
		TeXShop automatically adds \\section and \\chapter entries to the tab menu,\
		as suggested by several folks on the tex mailing list. There is a preference\
		to turn this feature off, but the preference has no graphical interface. To\
		turn it off, start terminal and type\
\
			defaults write texshop TagSections NO\
\
		Change "NO" to "YES" to turn the feature back on.\
\
		This version has improvements in the Spanish localization by Juan L. Varona,\
		improvements in the Italian localization by Giuseppe Carlino, improvements\
		in the German localization by Martin Kerz, and a new Portuguese \
		localization by Paulo T. Abreu.\
\
		The LatexTemplate has been dramatically simplified. The graphicx\
		package now automatically changes behavior when it\
		is called by pdftex rather than tex. When TeXShop is upgraded, it\
		will not replace the old copy of the template in ~/Library with the new\
		one because the user may have edited this template. But the TeXShop \
		folder in this release contains a copy of the new template; users may \
		wish to open ~/Library/TeXShop/Templates/LatexTemplate in\
		TeXShop and revise their old template.\
 \
	Bugs Fixed:\
\
		Saved documents again have type TEXT. This feature broke with system \
		10.1. The bug fix requires new Apple code which comes with system\
		10.1, so TeXShop now requires system 10.1 or higher.\
		\
		In previous versions of TeXShop, when a user typeset a document, came to\
		an error, fixed the error, and then typeset again without completing the\
		previous job, an extra folder was left in the /tmp directory. When typesetting was\
		done by pdftex or pdflatex, this folder contained a complete copy of the source\
		file. When typesetting was done by tex + ghostscript or latex + ghostscript,\
		the folder contained smaller files. Every time a typesetting job was \
		interrupted, a new folder was created in /tmp. These folders were not removed \
		until the user rebooted the machine. \
\
		This important bug is really two bugs, one for pdftex and pdflatex and another\
		for tex + ghostscript and latex + ghostscript. The bugs are fixed in TeXShop 1.14. \
		The tex/latex + ghostscript portion of the bug fix requires a new\
		altpdftex script, contained in the Gerben Wierda's teTeX release of\
		January 24, 2002. TeXShop will work with earlier Wierda releases, but then\
		the latex + ghostscript bug won't be fixed.\
\
		\
Version 1.15		February 7, 2002\
\
		A new menu item enables spell checking as you type. The initial setting \
		of this menu is determined by a preference item, but the\
		setting can later be toggled. This change was prompted by the release of\
		the Unix spell checker Aspell for Mac OS X. This spell checker, by Kevin\
		Atkinson, is "a more intelligent Ispell." It was ported to Mac OS X by \
		Anton Leuski and converted into a spelling service. The spell checker \
		has a Latex filter, and so becomes the long-awaited "cocoa spell checker \
		for TeX." To obtain the spell checker, which is free, go to\
		http://homepage.mac.com/leuski/cocoaspell/ \
\
		The English version of the help file has been expanded. In particular, \
		operation of MetaPost is explained more clearly. These changes will eventually \
		appear in Internationalized versions of the help file.\
\
		The Latex Panel has been polished. For example, it is now \
		possible to select a section of text and then choose the typeface Emph; braces \
		will be placed around the selected text. The cursor is also placed more carefully \
		when items are inserted from the panel. \
\
		The elegant code for this change was written by Max Horn. Each palette\
		item is represented by a string in the file "completion.plist." This string will\
		be inserted into the source when the Palette item is chosen. Horn's code\
		allows the completion.plist string to contain #SEL#; each such occurance\
		is replaced by the current selection when the string is inserted. Similarly if\
		the completion.plist string contains #INS#, this will become the cursor\
		position when the string is inserted.\
\
		As soon as Geoff Lenglin heard of this code, he modified completion.plist\
		to take advantage of it. Other errors in completion.plist were fixed.\
\
		It is now possible to customize completion.plist. Recall that TeXShop adds\
		a folder ~/Library/TeXShop/Templates to the user Library for templates. If this\
		folder contains a folder ~/Library/TeXShop/LatexPanel containing a\
		completion.plist file, then this file will be used instead of the default file in\
		the TeXShop bundle. \
\
		Subsections and subsubsections are now added to the tags menu automatically.\
\
		TeXShop now has the option of loading and saving files using the\
		MacJapanese encoding. This change is due to Makoto Inoue, and makes\
		TeXShop compatible with the Japanese versions of TeX and LaTeX called ptex\
		and platex, available at ftp://ftp.ascii.co.jp/pub/TeX/ascii-ptex/.\
		 \
	Bugs Fixed:\
\
		If a user edited a file, closed it, and chose not to save the changes, the \
		associated pdf window might not close, leading to a crash at some later time. \
		This is fixed.\
		\
		Some panel entries like \\item inserted strings containing the illegal\
		character 0x007f. This is fixed.\
\
\
		\
Version 1.16		March 1, 2002\
\
		TeXShop can process .ins and .dtx files. Thanks to Niccola\
		Vitacolonna for suggesting this addition.\
\
		TeXShop has configurable toolbars. This is entirely the work of\
		Anton Leuski, who send code and nib files implementing the change.\
		Thanks for this crucial addition!\
\
		TeXShop supports Applescript. This is also the work of Anton\
		Leuski. Applescript support will improve gradually over the new few\
		versions of TeXShop.\
\
		TeXShop can rotate the pdf image for previewing. This is necessary \
		for certain slide packages. Thanks to Robert Love for requesting\
		this change (several times!).\
\
		The arrow keys now work in the preview window. The left arrow\
		gives the previous page, the home key gives the first page, the up arrow\
		scrolls upward a couple of lines, etc. Thanks to Hanspeter Schaub for\
		this suggestion. \
\
		Finally, TeXShop can be configured for an external editor. There is\
		a new menu item named "Open for Preview..." When this item is\
		chosen, the user is asked to select a tex source file. But only the\
		associated pdf preview window opens (if the source has not yet been\
		typeset, this preview window will be blank). Thanks to Leuski's toolbars,\
		the preview window can be configured to contain a typesetting button. \
		Users can open their source file in any editor. When it is time to typeset, they\
		save the changes in their editor, switch to the preview window,\
		and typeset. In this mode, TeXShop itself never opens or modifies the\
		source file. It simply passes this file to the Unix TeX or LaTeX process.\
\
		For users who prefer external editors most of the time, there is a new \
		preference item called "Configure for External Editor."\
		When this preference is chosen, the "Open" and "Open Recent..."\
		menus open tex source files in the above manner for editing with\
		an external editor. Moreover, the  "Open for Preview..." menu \
		becomes "Open for Editing..." and opens the source file in \
		TeXShop's internal editor for those rare occasions when the internal\
		editor is desired. Recall that the "Open" and "Open Recent..."\
		menus can also open jpg, tiff, ps, pdf, dvi, log, and other files; selecting\
		the new preference does not change this behavior.\
\
		Applescript support for the "external editor option" is still weak; it\
		will improve in the next version, making it possible to typeset entirely\
		from within an applescript-capable editor.\
		 \
	Bugs Fixed:\
\
		The encoding preference was broken in some internationalized versions\
		due to a missing tag. This was silently fixed in 1.15 and now officially fixed.\
		Thanks to Juan Luis Varona Malumbres for pointing it out.\
\
		Small changes were made in the Italian localization, as suggested by\
		Nicola Vitacolonna.\
\
		If the source document has serious errors, LaTeX may become confused and\
		generate a defective pdf file. Obviously TeXShop cannot display this\
		faulty preview image. But in past versions, TeXShop would then refuse\
		to preview the document after the errors had been corrected. The\
		document would have to be closed and reopened or TeXShop would\
		have to be restarted. This bug is now fixed. Thanks to my colleague \
		Jim Isenberg for complaining loudly.\
\
		While supplying the Spanish translation for TeXShop 1.16, Juan Luis Varona \
		Malumbres gave an alternate translation of the phrase "File format" in the\
		save dialog. However, we provided no such phrase. We investigated where\
		it came from, and it turns out that Apple automatically added an item to\
		the save dialog allowing users to choose between the extensions "tex,"\
		"ins," and "dtx." That is because TeXShop now declares that it is an \
		EDITOR of ins and dtx files. So we made TeXShop an editor of bib files \
		as well and now users can create a bib file from scratch and give it the \
		extension "bib" without going into the Finder. This fixes an earlier bug.\
\
Version 1.17		March 8, 2002\
\
	Bugs Fixed:\
\
		Previously, TeXShop could occasionally crash the first time the user pushed \
		the RETURN key after opening a new document. The problem is fixed.\
		Thanks to Nicolas Boccard for reporting the bug and sending a crash log. \
\
		In the "Engine" Preferences for "TeX + dvips + distiller", the defaults are now\
		set to\
\
			altpdftex  --dvipsopts "-Ppdf"\
\
		and\
\
			altpdflatex  --dvipsopts "-Ppdf"\
\
		rather than just "altpdftex" and "altpdflatex". Old users should change these\
		preferences by hand to obtain best results with the TeX + Ghostscript\
		typesetting option.\
\
		There are two Cocoa bugs that users must fix themselves by making slight\
		adjustments in window size:\
\
		 If the bottom of the editing window is slightly below the toolbar or slightly \
		below the bottom of the screen, Cocoa will not automatically scroll \
		the window when text is being selected. Resize the window slightly. If\
		new windows are positioned to make this problem occur always, reset the\
		initial window position in Preferences.\
\
		If a window refuses to be dragged down so portions lie behind the toolbar\
		and instead always snaps back to its original position,  resize the window \
		slightly and try again. If new windows are positioned to make this problem\
		occur always, reset the initial window position in Preferences.\
\
Version 1.18		March 18, 2002\
\
		TeXShop now has the option of loading and saving files using the\
		MacKorean encoding.\
\
		In version 1.17, the default script for tex + ghostscript was changed\
		from "altpdftex" to "altpdftex --dvipsopts "-Ppdf". But Gerben Wierda informs\
		me that a better default would be\
\
		     altpdftex --dvipsopts "-u +pdftex.map -u +Ttbbold.map -u +wolfram.map"\
\
		and a better default for latex + ghostscript would be\
\
		     altpdflatex --dvipsopts "-u +pdftex.map -u +Ttbbold.map -u +wolfram.map"\
\
		TeXShop now uses these defaults. Since new versions do not change\
		already chosen preferences, old users should change these\
		preferences by hand to obtain best results with the TeX + Ghostscript\
		typesetting option.\
		\
	Bugs Fixed:\
\
		A bug introduced in 1.16 caused the tag code to occasionally output\
		a huge number of error messages to the system log. A few users ran\
		out of memory and had to reboot. Version 1.18 was released mainly \
		to cure this bug. Thanks to Stuart Midgley for the error report. \
\
Version 1.19		March 30, 2002\
\
	Bugs Fixed:\
\
		If the user modifies settings in the Page Setup dialog, sources files are\
		marked as changed. Then when TeXShop quits, it puts up a dialog asking\
		if the changes should be saved. In previous versions, this dialog appeared\
		even if an external editor was being used, but in that case TeXShop did \
		not know the contents of the source file and replaced it with an empty file.\
		This important error was reported by Nelson Byrne and is fixed.\
\
		Changes were made in the Dutch and Portuguese localizations. \
\
Version 1.20		August 26, 2002\
\
	Bugs Fixed:\
\
		The syntax coloring code was changed to make the program responsive\
		under Jaguar. This is a preliminary fix; further changes will be made soon.\
\
Version 1.21		November 8, 2002\
\
		Default preferences for altpdftex and altpdflatex were changed to be compatible \
		with Gerben Wierda's latest distribution of TeX.\
\
	Bugs Fixed:\
\
		The syntax coloring code was changed for Jaguar. When a document is first\
		opened, TeXShop must syntax color everything. This can be done in two\
		ways: the document can be colored before its window opens, or the window\
		can be opened and then the syntax coloring can be applied gradually\
		as a background task.  Earlier versions of TeXShop used the second 		approach.  But in Jaguar, coloring in the background is dramatically slower than 		coloring before the document opens, so version 1.21 colors first. \
		Documents may take slightly longer to open, but the program should be\
		responsive as soon as they open. If users find this delay annoying, please\
		write me.\
\
Version 1.22		November 10, 2002\
\
	Bugs Fixed:\
\
		There are further improvements in the syntax coloring code. The\
		improvements introduced in version 1.21 only increased initial syntax\
		coloring speed when documents are opened. This time, the code used\
		when entering text has been improved. The crucial idea behind this\
		improvement was made by Martin Heusse. Thanks!!\
\
Version 1.23		November 11, 2002\
\
	Bugs Fixed:\
\
		If a typesetting operation quits prematurely and the user tries to interact with\
		the console by pushing the return key,  TeXShop crashed. This bug has\
		been fixed; it has existed for a long time.	\
\
Version 1.24		November 12, 2002\
		\
		Sections to be commented out can now contain comment lines. The "comment"\
		and "uncomment" commands will preserve these internal comments.\
\
	Bugs Fixed:\
\
		In version 1.23, when a line contained $, the following characters were incorrectly\
		colored green for a while. This is fixed.\
\
		In version 1.23, if the user set a different font or size in preferences, modifications\
		of the first text line would change that line of text to Helvetica 12 point type. This is fixed.\
\
Version 1.25		November 30, 2002\
\
		For a long time, it has been possible to configure TeXShop so it will not open an\
		empty document on startup.  If so configured, TeXShop no longer opens empty \
		documents when activated from the Dock. Thanks to Gerben Wierda for pointing out \
		the correct Cocoa call to implement this.\
\
		There is now a preference to set the width of tab stops.\
\
		Selection of text between matching parentheses has been improved. In earlier versions, \
		when a user selected a parenthesis, the entire text to the matching parenthesis would \
		also be selected. In the new version, nothing unusual happens when a parenthesis is\
		selected. If a user clicks once on a parenthesis, the cursor will be placed at that spot.\
		If a user clicks twice on a parenthesis, the parenthesis will be selected. If a user clicks\
		three times on a parenthesis, the entire text to the matching parenthesis will be\
		selected. If there is no match, the line containing the parenthesis will be selected.\
\
		Martin Heusse has modified Nicol\'87s Ojeda B\'8ar's code so it also respects initial\
		spaces on lines. If a line starts with several tabs or spaces, the following lines will also \
		start with these tabs or spaces until they are canceled. \
\
	Bugs Fixed:\
\
		The color syntax code for Jaguar has been improved. Earlier versions created bugs\
		in continuous spell checking; these are fixed. Earlier versions also caused the editor to\
		forget the current font occasionally; this is fixed.\
\
		A week ago, Bruno Voisin reported a crashing bug when a left parenthesis toward the\
		end of text was selected and the parenthesis had no match. This is fixed.\
\
		Sarah Childers reported (and fixed!) a bug involving Templates. TeXShop was supposed\
		to allow users to remove or rename files in ~/Library/TeXShop/Templates. In that way,\
		the Templates menu could be customized. However, TeXShop actually recreated files which\
		were renamed or removed. This is fixed. Childers sent the appropriate repair code, which is\
		used unchanged in version 1.25. (Incidentally, the default templates can be recreated\
		by removing the entire folder ~/Library/TeXShop/Templates)\
\
Version 1.26		January 2, 2002\
\
		TeXShop now supports ISO Latin 2, UTF-8 Unicode, Standard OSX Unicode, \
		Japanese (ShiftJIS 1), Japanese (ShiftJIS 2), and Japanese (EUC) file formats.\
		See the English version of the help file for tips on using unicode with TeX.\
\
		TeXShop has a Japanese localization by Seiji Zenitani.\
\
		The Latex Panel has a Custom tab where users can add up to sixteen of their own\
		symbols. This code is by Georg Klein.\
\
		It is now possible to customize all keyboard menu shortcuts.\
\
		An auto completion facility has been provided by Greg Landweber. For instance, typing\
		^ gives ^\{  \}  with the cursor placed between the two brackets. This facility can be turned\
		on or off in preferences, and can be completely customized by the user.\
\
		TeXShop can open and save metafont (mf) and metapost (mp) files. It can now open,\
		edit, and save any text file.\
\
		Basic metafont support has been added.\
\
		Preference defaults and the Latex Template have been modified to allow automatic\
		conversion of eps files to pdf files and automatic conversion of tif files to png files\
		during typesetting with pdflatex. Effectively, pdflatex can use any graphic format\
		from the list pdf, eps, jpg, tif, png.\
\
		A configure menu item now brings up a TextEdit document explaining changes\
		in default preferences and default templates. The document explains how to make\
		power user changes in TeXShop configuration. It contains a list of important web sites.\
\
	Bugs Fixed:\
\
		The German localization and some internal code have been improved by Max Horn.\
\
		TeXShop inserted a \\b at the start of new files; it no longer does this.\
\
		When saving a file, the undo stack is no longer initialized.\
\
		Additional improvements in syntax coloring code have been made.\
\
		The "indent" command now inserts tabs instead of spaces.\
\
Version 1.27		January 17, 2003\
\
		The majority of new features in this version are due to Mitsuhiro Shishikura,\
		who sent them just as version 1.26 was being released. The new TeXShop \
		source code contains a folder with the email messages sent by Shishikura; \
		they provide an excellent model of the correct way to suggest changes. \
		Shishikura sent revised source code, a description of what the changes \
		were supposed to accomplish, and a description of exactly where the \
		source code changed.\
\
		Shishikura additions:\
\
		Pressing the mouse in the pdf display magnifies a small surrounding\
		section of the display. Holding the option key while pressing enlarges\
		the section being magnified.\
\
		A new macros menu and marcos button in the toolbar define an alternate way\
		to insert text into the source document. Items in this menu behave \
		like buttons in the existing Latex Panel. In addition, AppleScript items\
		in the menu run user defined scripts. For example, a default script opens\
		the pdf output in Adobe Acrobat. \
\
		A Macro Editor is provided to modify the Macros menu, defining new macros\
		and rearranging the existing items in the menu. The help menu contains\
		an item displaying help for this editor.\
\
		User inputs in the console window are added in red to the display at the\
		top of this window, so this display has a complete record of interaction with\
		TeX during typesetting. \
\
		Added support for file types .def, fd, .ltx, .clo\
\
		Added a "Typeset" menu, with keyboard shortcut command-T. This typesets the\
		file with the currently chosen program. To make this change, the typeset\
		menu and toolbar items have been rearranged to behave in a more\
		rational way.\
\
		Extensive support was added for users in Japan. An additional encoding,\
		Japanese (JIS), is added to those defined by Seiji Zenitani in verison 1.26.\
		Earlier versions required special versions of completion.plist when using the\
		Japanese "yen" encoding; this is no longer necessary. (Explanation for users\
		not in Japan: Japanese keyboards often omit the \\ character, replacing it with\
		the "yen" character \'b4. A special version of tex is available which uses \'b4\
		rather than \\ as a TeX escape character. TeXShop recognizes this \
		substitution when using the encoding Japanese (ShiftJIS \'b4).)\
\
		The following change was inspired by a contribution from John.Nairn, to be\
		listed in a minute:\
\
		The "Set Project Root" behavior of TeXShop has changed. Users writing\
		books often organize the project as follows:  a master source file, perhaps\
		called "Main.tex," is created. This file defines global macros and then inputs\
		the sources for individual chapters. The source files for these chapters are\
		contained in subfolders, one for each chapter. In TeXShop, it is possible to\
		associate a "root file" with each chapter file. In previous versions, when the chapter\
		was typeset, TeXShop actually typeset Main.tex and associated the resulting pdf\
		file with the chapter. If several chapters were open at once, several copies of the\
		book pdf file would appear. In the new program, this does not happen. Instead, when\
		the chapter is typeset, TeXShop opens Main.tex if it is not already open and typesets\
		this file. So only one pdf file is displayed, even if several chapter files are open.\
\
		The two additions below were contributed by John Nairn:\
\
		It is no longer necessary to set the project root for each chapter. Instead, include\
		a line of code in the chapter source of the form "%SourceDoc ../Main.tex" without\
		the quotations to achieve the same effect. (Nairn's code behaved as described in\
		the previous paragraph; TeXShop has been revised so root files can be set in\
		two different ways, but both ways produce the same effect.)\
\
		A new preference item has been added called "During File Save, Save Related\
		Files." When a document is typeset, it is first saved. If this item is checked, the\
		document will also be searched for \\Input lines, and if the resulting files are also\
		open in TeXShop, they will also be saved.\
\
		Localization support for Japanese and Italian is improved.\
\
		TeXShop now keeps configuration files for Templates, the Latex Panel, the\
		Macros Menu, possible redefinition of menu keyboard shortcuts, and possible\
		autocompletion codes in subfolders of the folder ~/Library/TeXShop. These\
		folders are created with default configuration files when TeXShop first starts.\
		To move TeXShop to a different machine preserving these configurations,\
		copy the ~/Library/TeXShop folder to the new machine.\
\
	Bugs Fixed:\
\
		New documents are now titled "Untitled", "Untitled-1", "Unititled-2", etc. \
		In TeXShop 1.26 and earlier, these names contained spaces even though TeX\
		cannot process file names with spaces. I tried to fix this bug several times \
		without success; the fix is due to Shishikura.\
\
		Preference acceptance of changes made by typing in text boxes has improved.\
		\
		Several users wrote that their preference changes of default pdf magnification\
		were not accepted when they pressed "OK." Until recently, I could not reproduce\
		this bug. It turns out that the pdf window had to be open when making the\
		preference change or else the change would appear to work but wouldn't. This\
		is fixed.\
\
		TeXShop can display jpg and tiff files. In 1.26 and earlier, the display window\
		was blank if the default pdf magnification was not 1. This is fixed. \
		\
		When syntax coloring, TeXShop interpreted the sequence \\% as the beginning\
		of a comment. This is fixed.\
		\
Version 1.28		January 29, 2003\
\
		 TeXShop finally uses the Apple Help System. This change is entirely due to Martin Kerz, \
		who wrote all of the html code. Much easier to use than the old version!\
\
		The magnification glass has additional behavior. Holding down the command \
		key while mousing sets magnification level much as the option key does, except \
		that this level is then remembered until the window closes. If it is set to large mode, \
		then holding down the option key temporarily magnifies in small mode. \
\
		There is a new preference to set the background color of the source window. This \
		preference has no interface. To reset it to (r, g, b) = (.42, .39, .77), issue the commands \
\
			-  defaults write TeXShop background_R .42\
			-  defaults write TeXShop background_G .39\
			-  defaults write TeXShop background_B .77\
\
		The values should be between 0.00 = black and 1.00 = white. Default is r = g = b = 1.00. \
\
		There is a new German localization by Martin Kerz, and a new Spanish localization by \
		Juan Luis Varona Malumbres. \
\
		The "root file" behavior was slightly modified as requested by Gary Gray. If the \
		user opens a file which has a root file set by the "%SourceDoc" mechanism or \
		by the "Set Root File" mechanism, then the root file is also opened. This means, \
		in particular, that the pdf preview window opens. If the file is already open, then \
		nothing unusual happens. But if the root file is not open, then after it is opened the \
		source file of the root file is miniaturized. This is done by the zoom mechanism \
		(mainly because I don't know how to turn that zoom off). The zoom is a little surprising, \
		but after a while it makes sense; TeXShop is saying "there is a root file and it is down \
		here in the dock if you ever need it." \
	\
		A new toolbar item allows users to turn autocompletion on or off rapidly on a \
		document by document basis. This idea (with sample code) comes from Maarten Sneep.\
\
		In the past, if more than one item in the tags menu had the same text, only the first item \
		was shown. This bug is fixed in 1.28 by Seiji Zenitani.
\f2 \

\f0  \
	Bugs Fixed:\
\
		 A bug reported by Michael Murray has been fixed: the program selection tabs in \
		the source and pdf windows weren't synchronized, so the typeset command \
		sometimes did something unexpected.\
 \
		Richard Hazeltine ran into a bug in which his main.tex file had an associated root \
		file main.texshop which contained "main.tex". In the past this would be harmless, \
		but in TeXShop 1.27 it created an infinite loop. TeXShop is now protected against this \
		simple kind of infinite loop; in this special case, the file will typeset normally. Cases in \
		which f1.texshop points to f2.tex and f2.texshop points to f1.tex will still create \
		an infinite loop. \
\
Version 1.29		July 11, 2003\
\
		New PDF display options have been provided by Mitsuhiro Shishikura. The original\
		page by page option is still available, but it is now also possible to scroll through the\
		entire pdf document or to display two pages side by side. The default choice can\
		be set in Preferences and the display can later be changed by menu action.\
\
		Shishikura has also modified the magnification options for preview display. The\
		original option is still available, but it is now possible to display in actual size, or fit\
		the display to the size of the window. A default choice can be set in Preferences\
		and the magnification behavior can later be changed at will by menu.\
\
		The magnification glass behavior has changed slightly. A toolbar item fixes the\
		size of the region to be magnified; double or triple clicking enlarges this size.\
\
		It is possible to select a portion of the pdf preview display and copy and paste the\
		resulting graphic into another program. Drag and drop of the selection is also supported.\
		Preference items allow users to select the file type of the copy (pdf, png, jpg, tiff, etc.)\
		and the foreground and background colors and transparency. This feature is also\
		due to Shishikura.\
\
		Preview selection combined with drag and drop can be used with Keynote. \
		Using the default copy preferences, a text selection can be dropped on a Keynote slide; \
		the background of the text will be transparent, so the slide background will show between the\
		letters. This text can be resized since the default copy format is pdf.\
\
		Seiji Zenitani has added the ability to drag and drop files onto the source window.\
		If a tex file is dropped, an "\\input " command will be added there with a relative\
		path to the file. If a graphic file is dropped, an "\\includegraphics " command will\
		be added.\
\
		Shishikura also added command completion. Type the first few letters of a word and\
		hit the escape key. The remaining letters will be entered. Hitting escape again will\
		cycle through all possible completions. Initially this will have limited usefulness because\
		the completion dictionary is almost empty. To add a word to the dictionary, select the\
		word and choose "Add Word" under the Format menu. Notice that this menu\
		command has a key equivalent. To see and edit the entire dictionary, choose\
		"Open Completion File" under the Format menu. Notice that the completion can be\
		more complicated than just a single word, and the cursor can be placed correctly\
		within this completion. Examine the samples provided in the default file for details. \
		This feature will be improved in later versions.\
\
		The source window can now be split, so one section can be written while another\
		section is visible in the window. Keyboard input can go to either split portion and will\
		also immediately appear in the other portion.\
\
		The source and preview window toolbars now work in text only mode. \
\
		Added support for ISO Latin 5 as required for Turkish, and for several\
		Russian formats. Vladimir Novikov was helpful providing information\
		about which formats to support.\
\
		Some users must deal with a number of file encodings. For these users, the open and\
		save panels now allow the file encoding to be individually chosen for a file. When a file\
		is first opened, the default encoding will be the one listed in preferences, so most users\
		can ignore this new choice. If a different encoding is chosen when a file is opened,\
		that encoding will be the default choice when the file is later saved. \
\
		A small number of users ran into the following problem. They would receive a file \
		with one encoding, say UTF-8, but mistakenly open it with another encoding, say \
		Mac OS Roman. If they did not notice the problem, they might typeset the file. \
		Typesetting always saves the file first, so the original file would\
		be overwritten with a file in a different encoding, losing information. TeXShop now has\
		a hidden preference to provide some protection in this situation. It is possible to instruct\
		TeXShop to save a backup file when saving or typesetting. To turn this on, type the\
		following command in Terminal:\
\
			defaults write TeXShop SaveBackup YES\
\
		Support for epsi files was added.\
\
		The default commands for pdftex and pdflatex are now "pdftex --shell-escape" and\
		"pdflatex --shell-escape." The "shell-escape" portion of this text tells pdftex that it is\
		legal to run other programs during typesetting. This is useful because if tex finds a\
		graphic file in an unsupported format, it can automatically call another program to\
		convert it to supported format. For example, the default Latex template automatically\
		converts tif files to png and automatically converts eps files to pdf.\
\
		This creates one difficulty that may worry some users. The "shell-escape" flag allows pdftex\
		to run ANY program. Thus a disgruntled student could send you a tex source file\
		by email and when you typeset it you would discover that some of the files in your\
		directory had been erased.\
\
		I believe the danger is slight. A source file which did harm would have to be created\
		deliberately; sending a "virus" via tex source seems somewhat esoteric. Nevertheless,\
		there are two ways that you can protect yourself. The first and easiest is to remove the\
		letters "--shell-escape" from the two spots they occur in Preferences and then convert\
		all of your graphic files by hand.\
\
		TeXShop now provides a different protection. A preference item under the Engine\
		tab is labeled "Shell Escape Warning;" this item is off when TeXShop is delivered.\
		If the item is on and "shell-escape" is active, then the first time a file is typeset during\
		a TexShop session, a warning dialog will appear allowing you to turn shell-escape\
		off for that particular file. This dialog will not appear again during the session for that\
		particular file. Thus you can typeset your own files using "shell-escape" and typeset\
		files received in the mail without "shell-escape."\
\
		TeXShop can now create submenus in the Templates menu. To do so, create folders\
		in the Templates folder. This code was written by Seiji Zenitani.\
\
		It has always been possible to color TeX output. To do so, add the line\
\
			\\usepackage\{color\}\
\
		to the preamble, and insert a line like\
\
			\\color\{blue\}\
\
		before typesetting begins. To color a limited section of text, use a command like\
\
			\{\\color\{red\} This is very important!\}\
\
		To define custom colors, use a command like\
\
			\\definecolor\{mycolor\}\{rgb\}\{0.2, 0.7, 0.8\}\
\
		When output is colored, the output may be difficult to read on the preview screen.\
		TeXShop has hidden preferences to set the background color of the preview window.\
		This background color will not appear when the document is printed. To set the\
		background to gray, issue the following commands in Terminal:\
\
			defaults write TeXShop Pdfbackground_R 0.5\
			defaults write TeXShop Pdfbackground_G 0.5\
			defaults write TeXShop Pdfbackground_B 0.5\
\
		Change 0.5 to 1 to get back to white. If you find yourself changing the background often,\
		create an Applescript macro named "PDF background gray" with the Macro Editor\
		using the following text:\
\
		     --AppleScript\
		     do shell script "defaults write TeXShop Pdfbackground_R 0.5"\
		     do shell script "defaults write TeXShop Pdfbackground_G 0.5"\
		     do shell script "defaults write TeXShop Pdfbackground_B 0.5"\
\
		and create a similar macro named "PDF background white". \
\
		The German help file was revised by Martin Kerz and Laurent Meister. Additional French\
		localization was proved by Jean-Claude De Soza. Additional Spanish localizations\
		were proved by Juan Luis Varona Malumbres.\
\
\
	Bugs Fixed:\
\
		Undo is now permitted past typesetting operations and file saves. Thus it is possible\
		to typeset and then undo several changes made before the typesetting command.\
		This bug was fixed earlier, but the fix created problems and had to be removed.\
		Now the fix is back for good.\
\
		When a user closed a document and then tried to throw the pdf away, the Finder\
		complained that it was still open. TeXShop would have to quit before the pdf\
		could be thrown away. This bug was fixed by Wolfgang Lux.\
\
		The error coding failed for the new root file behavior. If "chapter1" had a root file, \
		then after typesetting control-E and the error menu command would be inactive.\
		This is fixed.\
\
		The \\phi and \\varphi symbols were reversed in the Latex Panel. This was reported\
		by Oleg Skipa and Rob Leigh and is now fixed. The code inserted by the "[" and\
		"]" symbols in the Latex Panel is now correct, and the cursor is conveniently\
		placed for the "Equations" entry.\
\
		The metapost script was improved by Joseph C. Slater.\
\
		Some international characters in autocompletion.plist were repaired by Alexander\
		Wittig. \
\
		In German, the latex panel initially required two clicks to open. This is fixed.\
 \
				\
	Version 1.30		July 16, 2003\
\
	Bugs Fixed:\
\
		When TeXShop was hidden and later shown, the source window scrolled to the\
		top. This is fixed.\
\
		Other bugs in split window were fixed.\
\
		The right mouse again works in the source window.\
\
		When the toolbar was displayed in text only mode, menus behaved strangely.\

\cf2 					\cf0 Macros items are now specific to the typesetting engine set in the current\
					window. Two default sets are created when TeXShop first starts, one for\
					Latex and one for Context. (The Context set was created by Hans Hagen;\
					thanks!). Suppose a different engine is selected, say TeX. When it\
					starts, it will have the default Latex macros. But if this set of Macros\
					is edited with the Macro editor, the new set will always be associated\
					with TeX, while the old Latex macros will continue to be associated\
					with Latex. Of course the Latex macros can also be changed.\
\
\cf2 					\cf0 A new preference item allows the first page in the two double page modes\
					to be either on the left or on the right. Books usually put this page on\
					the right, so that is the default preference.\
\
\cf2 					\cf0 The preference dialog has a new pulldown menu to reset preferences to\
					default values. This addition was requested by Seiji Zenitani for users in\
					Japan who must cope with three different versions of pTeX. These users can\
					now rapidly set preferences without consulting documentation on web sites.\
\
\cf2 					\cf0 The largest possible magnification in the preview window is\
					now 1000 (previously it was 400).\
\
\cf2 					\cf0 Additional French menu translations by Hendrik Chaltin; thanks!\
\
					The command to switch between source and preview windows was changed\
					from control-1 to command-1 and a menu was added for this task.\

\cf2 					\cf0 Three Panther problems are fixed. A few interface changes\
					were made to improve appearance in Panther. This\
					release is essential for Panther. \
\
\cf2 						\cf0 In Panther, older versions of TeXShop refuse to create\
						new files, although they can open existing files. This was fixed \
						by adding two lines to the "displayName" code.\
\
	\cf2 					\cf0 In Panther, the small yellow tags which display the current\
						page when scrolling in multipage and double multipage display\
						formats were blank. Also, the small yellow tags which display\
						the size of a selection rectangle to copy\
						a portion of the pdf window were blank. This is fixed.\
\
	\cf2 					\cf0 On my system, Panther spellchecking often fails for all\
						programs. This happens at boot time. The computer boots\
						up, but even if the first program used is TextEdit or Mail, it refuses\
						to "spell check as you type" and the "Spelling dialog" refuses\
						to appear.\
\
	\cf2 					\cf0 I suspect this is due to a defective third party program on my\
						disk, since other Panther users haven't seen the problem. But\
						I haven't been able to isolate the bug.\
\
	\cf2 					\cf0 Once the problem occurs, TextEdit and Mail have minor text\
						input glitches which are cured by turning off continuous spell\
						checking. TeXShop had more serious glitches in this situation.\
						So in 1.31, extra code has been added to turn off continuous\
						spell checking when TeXShop starts if the spell checker is not\
						available.\
\
					Fixed a bug reported by Luis Sequeira: when text was dragged within\
					the source window, it was always copied and pasted. It should have been cut and\
					pasted unless the option key was down. This is fixed. \
\
\cf2 					\cf0 Juan Luis Varona Malumbres slightly improved Spanish help (small\
					icon for the list of help files in the drawer).\
\
\cf2 					\cf0  In two page mode, typesetting no longer scrolls to the first\
					page.\
\
\cf2 					\cf0 The new page and magnification buttons retain firstResponder\
					status (as before 1.29) so users can experiment with several\
					settings without clicking again for each experiment.\
\
\cf2 					\cf0 In version 1.30 and before, if the user input an impossible line \
					into the "Go To Line" dialog, the program could crash; this is fixed. \
					Thanks to Eric Seidel for the bug report.\
\
\cf2 					\cf0 Kevin Ballard, kevin@sb.org, contributed a new English.lproj folder\
					with revised placement of interface items in preferences, slightly revised\
					menu items, and other changes to improve the look of the interface\
					in Panther. Many thanks!\
\
\cf2 					\cf0 Made spacing changes for Panther in the German preference panel.\
					Thanks to Martin Kerz for the suggestions.\
\
\cf2 					\cf0 There is a hidden preference item to turn off tag computation:\
					"defaults write TeXShop TagSections NO" but this preference was disabled\
					somewhere along the line and certainly in 1.30. It is enabled again.\
\
					The Preferences Panel is no longer deactivated when TeXShop is \
					deactivated.\

\cf2 					\cf0 There is a new menu item, "New Tag", which inserts an empty tag in the\
					source text and positions the cursor so the user can add the name of the tag.\
					As a corollary, there is now a keystroke to add a new tag; the keystroke\
					is command-2.\
\
					In Applescript macros, the terms #LOGPATH#, #AUXPATH#, #INDPATH#,\
					#BBLPATH#, and #HTMLPATH# will now be recognized; this has been added\
					at the request of Claus Gerhardt.\
\
					The drag and drop code has been improved by Seiji Zenitani. Dropping\
					files of types pdf, jpg, jpeg, tif, tiff, eps, or ps on the source document will\
					produce \\includegraphics and a reference to the file. Dropping a file of type\
					cls, sty, or bib will \\documentclass, \\usepackage, or \\bibliographystyle and\
					a file reference. Dropping any other text file will produce \\input and a file\
					reference.\
\
					There is a new preference to set the program called by MetaPost. See the\
					TeXShop help file for an explanation.\
\
					There is a new preference to set the program called by BibTeX. This\
					preference is required because jbibtex is used in Japan.\

\cf2 					\cf0 Although the magnification level can increase to 1000 in version 1.31, \
					the arrow keys next to the magnification control only allowed values up to\
					400. This is fixed.\
\
					If the preview window's toolbar was in text-only mode and the magnification\
					panel was selected, the resulting small dialog window would not go away\
					in 1.31. This is fixed.\
\
					In Preferences, if the user set the tab size or the preview window magnification\
					and then cancelled, the new values would still appear when the Preference\
					panel was again displayed. This is fixed.\
\
					Suppose the preference to place the first page on the right side is active.\
					In 1.31, the left arrow key did now work in double page mode, and the right arrow\
					key stopped one page before the end. In double multipage mode, the end\
					key, the page down key, and the right arrow key stopped before displaying\
					the last page. All of these problems are fixed.\

				Version 1.33		November 29, 2003\
\pard\tx1440\tx2180\tx2800\tx4320\tx5760\tx7200\li1480\fi-20\ql\qnatural
\cf0 		\
		The changes in version 1.33 support improved apple scripting,\
		better macro support, and improved interaction with external editors.\
\
		Improved macro support was prompted by Claus Gerhardt, who wrote several\
		useful scripts included with version 1.33. For example, one script calls htlatex\
		to typeset a latex file for the web. The script saves the source, typesets,\
		and opens the resulting html file in Safari. Thus the script behaves exactly like\
		the Latex typesetting button except that it creates an html rather than a pdf, \
		and displays the html in Safari rather than TeXShop. An advantage of this\
		approach is that users can create their own scripts similarly and thus add features\
		to TeXShop without waiting for new program code.\
\
		TeX typesetting often requires a sequence of operations. To process a file with\
		a bibliography, the source must be run through latex, bibtex must be run, \
		and latex must be run twice more. A script is included to do this automatically.\
		The script saves the source before the first latex run and updates the preview display\
		at the end. Users can easily customize this script for their own workflow.\
\
		Additional scripts convert the tex source file to a file with Windows line feed\
		convention, or a file with Macintosh 9 line feed conventions, or a file with Unix\
		line feed conventions. Mac OS X understands all line feeds without help, but\
		many computers are not so smart; the conversions are useful when sending\
		files to friends. The "flip" binary used to do this conversion was written by\
		Craig Stuart Sapp. See http://ccrma-www.stanford.edu/~craig/utility/flip/ for details.\
\
		A script is included to call pdfselect and extract portions of pdf documents.\
		A user could request one file containing pages 3 through 7 of the tex document, one \
		containing page 29, and one containing pages 31  through 36. The advantage of placing \
\pard\tx560\tx1120\tx1680\tx2240\tx2800\tx3360\tx3920\tx4480\tx5040\tx5600\tx6160\tx6720\ql\qnatural
\cf0 					this code in the Macros menu is that a user interface is provided, so users don't \
					need to remember calling conventions for pdfselect and don't need to switch \
					to the Terminal.\
\
					A #DOCUMENTNAME# variable was added to the Macro editor, giving \
					applescript commands the name of the calling document.\
\pard\tx1440\tx2180\tx2800\tx4320\tx5760\tx7200\li1480\fi-20\ql\qnatural
\cf0 \
		The following applescript commands were added to TeXShop. Consult the \
		TeXShop help files for details about writing your own scripts using these commands.\
	\
			typeset		typesetinteractive\
			tex		texinteractive\
			latex		latexinteractive			context		contextinteractive\
			bibtex		bibtexinteractive\
			metapost		metapostinteractive\
			makeindex		makeindexinteractive\
			\
			refreshpdf\
			refreshtext\
			taskdone\
		\
		Improved support was added for external editors, following prodding by Joachim Kock.\
		Several changes have been made:\
\
		     a) There is now a preference to turn on continuous updating of the\
		     preview window if the user is running in external editor mode. Once each\
		     second the program checks to see if the pdf file has been updated. If so,\
		     it refreshes the pdf display. \
\
		     The interval between refresh checks is controlled by a hidden preference item\
\pard\tx560\tx1120\tx1680\tx2240\tx2800\tx3360\tx3920\tx4480\tx5040\tx5600\tx6160\tx6720\ql\qnatural
\cf0 					     named RefreshTime. To reset to another interval in seconds (say every 2.19\
					     seconds)\
\pard\tx1440\tx2180\tx2800\tx4320\tx5760\tx7200\li1480\fi-20\ql\qnatural
\cf0 			\
			defaults write TeXShop RefreshTime 2.19\
\
		     b)  Applescript command support has been added to TeXShop so external\
		     applications can send commands to it. For external editors, the important\
		     script commands are\
\
			latexinteractive	refreshpdf\
			texinteractive	taskdone\
			bibtexinteractive	open_for_externaleditor\
			contextinteractive\
			metapostinteractive\
			makeindexinteractive\
			typesetinteractive\
\
		     The commands in the left column call TeXShop's typesetting engine. When \
		     one of these commands is called, control immediately returns\
		     to the calling program even though the typesetting operation is not complete. The\
		     taskdone command returns FALSE while this operation continues and TRUE when it\
		     is done, so a calling program wishing to send several commands can send one\
		     command and then test that it has been completed before sending another command.\
\
		     Refreshpdf updates the preview display, and can be used instead of\
		     continuous updating to control that display. Typesetting commands automatically\
		     update the display upon completion.\
\
		     The open_for_externaleditor command opens a .tex file, calling "Open for Preview..."\
\
		Additional features not related to scripting or external editors have also been\
		added:\
\
\pard\tx560\tx1120\tx1680\tx2240\tx2800\tx3360\tx3920\tx4480\tx5040\tx5600\tx6160\tx6720\ql\qnatural
\cf2 					\cf0 "Select All" can be used to select the full page of pdf output in selection mode.\
					There is one restriction; in Multi-Page and Double-Multi-Page mode, select all is\
					only active if the document has at most 20 pages, since otherwise the\
					selected pdf will be enormous and bring the machine to a crawl.\
\
					A preference item now allows users to distill with Apple's pstopdf rather than\
					ghostscript. This only works in Panther because pstopdf is only in Panther.\
					If the preference is chosen but Panther is not running, the old ghostscript code\
					will be used. When the preference is chosen, ghostscript is no longer needed\
					for internal TeXShop scripts, but it may still be required for teTeX style files.\
					One such case is epstopdf.sty, used to automatically convert eps files to pdf\
					format during typesetting.\
\
					Zenitani provided additional drag and drop support. The new version reports\
					an error if the filename of the dropped file contains a space. The new code also\
					permits customization, in a somewhat strange way. To customize drag and drop\
					code, add a new submenu to the Macros menu titled "Drag & Drop". Inside this\
					folder, insert items for file types and make the text of each item be the code\
					to be produced by drag and drop. For example, one item might be called ".pdf"\
					and the body of this item might be "\\includegraphics[#INS#]\{%r\}" where neither\
					item would include the quotation marks. In these inclusions, \
\
						%F full path of an dropped file\
						%f dropped filename\
						%r relative path of the dropped file\
						%n filename without extension\
						%e extension\
\
					If an extension is not listed in the Drag & Drop menu, or if there is no such menu,\
					then drag and drop behaves as Zenitani proscribed, so most users won't need to\
					customize the code.\
\
					If the dropped pdf file is originally exported from LaTeX Equation Editor, and if \
					its file size is not too large (less than 1MB), TeXShop reads back equations from \
					the file. If you don't like this, option-drag the file.\
\
					German help has been updated by Martin Kerz, the Italian localization has been\
					updated by Nicola Vitacolonna, the Spanish help was updated by Juan Luis Varona\
					Malumbres, the French localization was updated by Hendrik Chaltin, and a\
					Romanian localization was added by Andrei Teleman. Thanks!\
\
					Macros can now be called when the preview window is active; commands which\
					insert text will be deactivated in this mode. A toolbar item for the Preview window\
					was added so the Preview toolbar can display a Macros button.	\

\cf0 		An "Abort" button was added to the console for people who want to stop the typesetting\
		program in midstream. This is a minor change.\

					compares the dates of the source and preview files. If the preview file is not up to\

	Bugs Fixed:\

		A few users reported that their printers added a slight yellow background to the page. \
		Only a few printers had that problem. Frank Stengel discovered that it was caused\
\pard\tx560\tx1120\tx1680\tx2240\tx2800\tx3360\tx3920\tx4480\tx5040\tx5600\tx6160\tx6720\ql\qnatural
\cf0 					by a NSEraseRect call in the print drawing routine. This call has been removed;\
					now TeXShop prints using only one line, the vanilla Cocoa call\
					[myRep draw].\
\
\cf2 					\cf0 In Panther, all Text objects offer word completion. If a portion of a word is typed\
					and option-escape is typed, the system will offer a list of possible completions.\
					This works in TeXShop, TextEdit, and other Cocoa programs. But TeXShop's\
					Command completion was broken in Panther, and made it impossible to use\
					this new feature. This is fixed.\
\
					TextShop has an applescript command to add text, but this command did not\
					update the undo stack. This was fixed by Stefan Walsen; his patch is in version 1.33.\
\
					If the user printed the source and later printed the typeset document, the document\
					would be lowered on the page. This is fixed.\
\
		\cf2 			\cf0 Jerry Keough found a strange bug when using TeXShop in Jaguar. If the user's preference \
					setting asked that no empty document appear at startup  and if the user opened a document, \
					made the pdf window active, and then reached over and closed the source window, \
					the next menu use would crash the program. This bug did not occur in Panther. It is fixed.\

\cf2 					\cf0 Added a Matrix Panel by Jonas Zimmermann, zimmerleut@gmx.de. Many\
					thanks.\
\
					At the request of Claus Gerhardt, added an extra applescript command,\
					"goto line". For instance\
\
						tell front document of application "TeXShop"\
						goto line 15\
						end tell\
\
					Added a first cut at pdfsync. Clicking on a spot in the pdf file while holding down\
					the command key takes the user to the corresponding point in the source file.\
					If the source file has include files,  this operation will open\
					the appropriate include file and take the user to a point in that file. Read the\
					help file "General Help: Pdfsync" for important details. This change depends\
					on pdfsync.sty, a file create by Piero D'Ancona with improvements by J\'8er\'99me \
					Laurens.\
\
					Also added pdfsync the other way. Clicking on a spot in the source file (including\
					source files with root files) while holding down the command key will select\
					the corresponding page in the pdf file.\

\cf2 					\cf0 The TeX, Latex, Bibtex, Makeindex, Metapost, Context, and Metafont buttons\
					on the toolbar reset the default typesetting engine. This no longer happens.\
					Thus it is possible to hit the Bibtex button and then hit command-T to typeset\
					again.\
\
					The abort button on the console window did not stay fixed when the window\
					was resized. Thanks to Sean Luke for pointing out these first two errors.\
\
					The command-1 keystroke switches back and forth between the source and\
					preview windows. In previous versions, this did not work when a source\
					window had a root file set by myfile.texshop or %SourceDoc. This is now fixed.\
					Clicking command-1 while in the source brings up the corresponding preview\
					window. Clicking command-1 again brings up the original source file.\
					A given preview window may have several source files. Command-1\
					will bring up the last source file which was switched to the preview using\
					command-1, or  the root source file if there was no previous switch.\
\
					New Spanish help files by Juan Luis Varona Malumbres. Thanks.\
\
					Printing now respects the "scale" setting in Page Setup. It does not respect the\
					"paper size" setting since paper size is set in teTeX. Printing works like this:\
					the dimensions of the printed document are set by tex and encoded in the\
					pdf file; this pdf is resized by the scale factor if this factor is not 100%, but otherwise\
					is placed full size and centered on the printed page; usually the document size\
					and printed page size are the same, but in rare cases when they are not,\
					the edges of the document might be cut off.\

\cf0 Version 1.35		August 30, 2004\
\
\pard\tx560\tx1120\tx1680\tx2240\tx2800\tx3360\tx3920\tx4480\tx5040\tx5600\tx6160\tx6720\ql\qnatural
\cf2 					\cf0 An important recent development is the release of XeTeX and XeLaTeX by\
					Jonathan Kew. See\
\
						http://scripts.sil.org/xetex \
\
					XeTeX is not part of Gerben Wierda's standard installation, but it is available\
					with Wierda's i-Installer as an optional install directly from Jonathan Kew.\
					XeTeX can access Macintosh fonts directly, so TeX documents can be written\
					with Lucida Grande, Zapfino, and any other Mac font. Moreover, XeTeX\
					understands Unicode, so for example users can type Arabic into the\
					source window from right to left, typeset with TeX, and obtain Arabic\
					in the output window. In particular, XeTeX source documents have\
					UTF-8 Unicode encoding.\
\
					TeXShop 1.35 supports XeTeX directly as follows:\
\
						a) XeTeX and XeLaTeX are now available in the pull-down typesetting menu\
						on the source window\
\
						b) Using preferences, a user can make XeTeX or XeLaTeX the default\
						typesetting option\
\
						c) If one of the first twenty lines of the source has the form\
	\
							%!TEX encoding = UTF-8 Unicode\
\
						then that file will be loaded and saved with UTF-8 Unicode encoding,\
						regardless of the default encoding chosen for other documents\
\
						d) If the first line of the source has the form\
\
							%!TEX TS-program = xetex       or      %!TEX TS-program = xelatex\
\
						then the appropriate program will be used regardless of the\
						typesetting option chosen.\
\
					These XeTeX features form a special case of a new general method for adding\
					typesetting engines to TeXShop. There is a now a folder in ~/Library/TeXShop named\
					Engines; the files in this folder are shell scripts which call typesetting programs.\
					When TeXShop first starts, it examines this folder and adds the script names of\
					files it contains to the pull-down typesetting menu. Choosing one of these items and \
					pushing the Typeset button calls the script. Users can write their own scripts and add\
					them to the Engines folder.\
\
					Items in ~/Library/TeXShop/Engines can be chosen as default typesetting method\
					in TeXShop Preferences.\
\
					The typesetting program can be set in the source code by writing one of the following\
					on any of the first twenty lines of the source:\
\
						%!TEX TS-program = tex\
						%!TEX TS-program = latex\
						%!TEX TS-program = pdftex\
						%!TEX TS-program = pdflatex\
						%!TEX TS-program = personaltex\
						%!TEX TS-program = personallatex\
\
					This new syntax also works for any new typesetting engine added to \
					~/Library/TeXShop/Engines. For example, %!TEX TS-program = xelatex chooses\
					XeLaTeX.\
\
					The encoding used to open or save a file can be set by writing a line of the form\
					\
						%!TEX encoding = UTF-8 Unicode\
\
					as one of the first 20 lines of a source document. Any supported encoding is allowed;\
					TeXShop's Help Files list the string which must appear on the right for each of\
					these encodings. To bypass this behavior, hold down the option key while opening\
					a file.\
\
					The earlier SourceDoc syntax has been modified to conform with the above changes.\
					For example, to set the root file to ../Main.tex, write\
\
						%!TEX root =  ../Main.tex\
\
					(The old syntax is still supported for setting the program, encoding, and SourceDoc,\
					but users are urged to switch to this new syntax.) (In 1.37 and 2.00, the old syntax is not\
					supported by default. But there is a hidden preference to turn it back on:\
\
						defaults write TeXShop UseOldHeadingCommands YES\
\
					If this default is activated, the new syntax will be recognized, but the old syntax will also\
					be recognized.)\
\
					TeXShop has a new Find panel by Isao Sonobe. This panel supports regular expressions.\
					Users can switch between the new panel and the original one in Preferences.\
					The Find panel depends on OgreKit, a Cocoa framework for handling regular\
					expressions by Sonobe. See\
\
						http://www-gauge.scphys.kyoto-u.ac.jp/~sonobe/OgreKit/\
\
					OgreKit is distributed using a slightly modified version of the BSD license. This\
					license can be found in the Documentation included directly in the OgreKit Framework\
					folder in the TeXShop source distribution. OgreKit requires Panther, so the new panel\
					will only appear on machines running Panther.\
\
					There are many nice features in this new Find panel, which users can discover for\
					themselves. OgreKit modifies the "Find" menu submenu of the TeXShop Edit menu,\
					replacing it with a more extensive menu. This might be confusing to Localizers,\
					because the menu in the TeXShop nib file is not the menu they will see when TeXShop\
					is running. The Find menu in the nib file should not be modified because it will\
					be active in system 10.2. Instead the corresponding menu in OgreKit needs to be\
					localized in the TeXShop source. The Find panel presents buttons controlling how\
					it will find words; the settings of the buttons will be remembered from session to\
					session. Adjust them until Find works as expected and then relax.\
\
					TeXShop 1.35 is distributed with the latest pdfsync.sty by Piero d'Ancona and J. Laurens.\
					This fixes typesetting problems caused by the version distributed with TeXShop 1.34.\
					 TeXShop did not keep up with the changes by d'Ancona and Laurens for several months; sorry!\
\
					In the new version, \\include and \\input are supported; to use the second, the syntax\
					\\input\{thisfile\} must be used rather than the syntax \\input thisfile. The new version\
					supports \\pdfsync, \\pdfsyncstart, and \\pdfsyncstop. Use the first of these commands\
					at any spot where you want to reference a point. If pdfsync breaks your code, enclose\
					the offending section in a \\pdfsyncstop, \\pdfsyncstart pair.\
\
					Suppose you are typesetting myfile.tex. Pdfsync creates a file named myfile.pdfsync\
					containing synchronization data. Roughly speaking, each data entry describes\
					a synchronization point as follows:\
\
						the page number of the output where the point occurs\
						the location on this page\
						the name of the source file producing this particular output\
						the line number in this source file for this particular output\
\
					There is a way to get TeXShop to display these synchronization points. The preview\
					window toolbar has a new checkbox item called SyncMarks. By default, this item is not\
					shown; use Customize Toolbar in the Window menu to select it. When the checkbox is\
					checked, synchornization points are shown. \
\
					By default, this item will not be checked when the Preview window first appears. A hidden\
					preference item can change this:\
\
						defaults write TeXShop ShowSyncMarks YES\
\
					TeXShop 1.35 has new matrix code by Jonas Zimmermann. The Matrix Panel now \
					makes tables. Examine the panel to find all of the new features. There is a hidden preference \
					to set the default size of the matrix:\
\
						defaults write TeXShop matrixsize 12\
\
					A very small number of users may have modified "matrixpanel.plist" in\
					~/Library/TeXShop/MatrixPanel. This plist has been extended; the new list is\
					called "matrixpanel_1.plist". Please edit this file to add your changes.\
\
					In previous versions of TeXShop, if you clicked elsewhere and then clicked on the\
					edit window to edit, you would need to click twice to correctly position the cursor.\
					This is now changed; the first click in the edit text is recognized and positions the\
					cursor.\
\
					When applescript runs under the Macro menu, it starts a small second application\
					embedded in the TeXShop folder to actually run the script. That is because when a\
					command like "latex" runs, and there is an error on the source, the console appears\
					to accept user input, but the TeXShop event loop is not running during the\
					applescript action, so no user input can occur.\
\
					Many applescripts do not have this problem. TeXShop now allows users to begin\
					applescript macros with the command\
\
						-- applescript direct\
\
					When written this way, the script will be run directly by TeXShop rather than by\
					the second small application.\
\
					Added a menu command "Trash AUX Files" and a button on the console "Trash\
					AUX Files." When involked, these commands move to the trash all files in the\
					current source directory with the same name as the source file and extensions\
					aux, bbl, blg, brf, glo, idx, ilg, ind, ioa, lof, log, lot, mtc, mlf, out, pdfsync, and toc.\
					Thanks to Will Robertson for suggesting this command and producing this list of\
					extensions.\
\
					Additional extensions can be added to this list with a hidden preference. To add\
					"dvi" to the list\
\
						defaults write TeXShop OtherTrashExtensions -array-add "dvi"\
\
					Several such extensions can be added in this way, one by one. To remove all\
					additions\
\
						defaults write TeXShop OtherTrashExtensions -array\
\
					The original list of extensions above will always remain active. \
\
					Suppose a book project has a main.tex file in a folder, and then chapters in subfolders\
					which are accessed using commands like \\include\{chapter1/chapter1.tex\}. When this\
					book is typeset, main.aux and other files will appear in the primary folder, and\
					chapter1.aux will appear in a subfolder. So the "Trash AUX Files" command does\
					not do a complete cleanup. But if the option key is pressed when the menu item\
					is chosen or the button on the console window is pressed, then\
\
						a) SourceDoc and Root File information will be used to find the\
						root document\
\
						b) All files with appropriate extensions listed above will be moved to the\
						trash from this folder and all subfolders, even if the name does not\
						agree with the name of the root file.\
\
					Some users may want to throw caution to the winds and arrange that "Trash AUX Files"\
					always performs this more extensive cleanup. A hidden preference allows this:\
					\
						defaults write TeXShop AggressiveTrashAUX YES\
\
					Added new templates by Will Robertson. These are heavily commented. It is\
					intended that users will edit them to fit their own requirements. The templates are\
					only installed if TeXShop is running for the first time, or if the Templates folder is\
					completely removed from ~/Library/TeXShop. But Will's templates are in a folder named\
					"More" in the TeXShop distribution; old users can obtain them by moving\
					"More" to ~/Library/TeXShop/Templates.\
\
					Added new macros by Will Robertson to create tables and arrays, to insert a reference,\
					and to open other project files quickly. These macros have been praised on\
					the TeX-On-MacOSX mailing list. The macros are available for new users;\
					older users can obtain them by following simple instructions which come with\
					TeXShop 1.35.\
\
					Added a macro to examine files in the teTeX tree. For example, if "article.sty" is\
					typed in the dialog produced by the Macro, kpsewhich is used to find this\
					file in the tree and open it in TeXShop.\
\
					There are hidden preferences to set the color of the text in the source window\
\
						defaults write TeXShop foreground_R  0.3\
						defaults write TeXShop foreground_G  0.3\
						defaults write TeXShop foreground_B  0.3\
					\
					This color will show if syntax coloring is on; otherwise it will be black and then\
					color can be selected in the Font menu.\
\
					When used with existing hidden preferences to set the source window background\
					color, these commands can be used to write source as white on black, or with\
					other color schemes. TeXShop has new macros to set the source window colors,\
					and to reset to default colors.\
\
					There are hidden preferences to make the source, preview, and console windows\
					partly transparent.\
\
						defaults write TeXShop ConsoleWindowAlpha 0.75\
						defaults write TeXShop SourceWindowAlpha 0.75\
						defaults write TeXShop PreviewWindowAlpha 0.75\
\
					Here an alpha value of 0.00 is completely transparent and an alpha value of 1.00 is\
					completely opaque. Use these commands cautiously!\
\
					TeXShop now has a Statistics panel, which lists the number of words, lines, and\
					characters in a document. This is obtained by calling\
\
						detex  myfile  |  wc\
\
					When first called, the document on disk is tested. After changes are made to the\
					document, the "update" button saves the document and calls detex again. The\
					detex command removes tex commands, but the word count is still only approximate.\
					Input and include files are counted by this command.\
\
					New German Help by Martin Kerz. Kerz also redesigned the TeXShop Help\
					Window to follow Apple's current guidelines. These changes appear in\
					English and German, but may not appear in other localizations.\
\
					When a file is drag-and-dropped, any alias is now resolved. Thus alias graphic\
					files (and other files) can be used provided they are dragged and dropped to the\
					source. Alias files will not work if their names are typed directly because the tex\
					engine does not understand aliases (it does understand symbolic links).\
\
					Several changes were made in the Japanese portions of the code by\
					Seiji Zenitani, with help from Yu Itoh and Koichi Inoue. There is a new Japanese\
					encoding, Shift JIS X0213, which will become a new standard in Japan. There is\
					now utf.sty support for pTeX. Before this change, Japanese pTeX supported only\
					6000 Kanji characters, but utf.sty supports more than 20,300 characters.\
					This support is turned on by a preference item in Misc. When on, TeXShop exports\
					non-ptex chracters as utf.sty codes. For example, unicode characters become\
					\\UTF(Hex code) and non-unicode characters become \\CID(glyph ID).\
\
					Zenitani also added new Japanese default settings. Previously, Japanese ptex\
					distributors provided their own "altpdflatex" scripts, which was confusing for\
					beginning users. This new version of TeXShop bundles "altpdflatex-for-ptex"\
					scripts and installs them in ~/Library/TeXShop/bin. The new Japanese default\
					settings in Preferences automatically set up TeXShop to use these new scripts. \
\
					Added the following Chinese encodings at the request of Adam Si:\
					Mac Chinese Traditional, Mac Chinese Simplified, DOS Chinese Traditional,\
					DOS Chinese Simplified, GBK, GB 2312, and GB 18030.\
\
					Added a new Japanese help system by Yoshihisa Okazaki.\
\
					Added new Spanish localization and help.  \
\
					TeXShop can now open and write files with extension .dn and .engine.\
\
					There is a hidden preference\
\
						defaults write TeXShop BringPdfFrontOnAutomaticUpdate NO\
\
					which causes the pdf window to remain where it is when it automatically updates\
					and is used with an external editor. This preference was requested by a user \
					with an X11 editor and only seems necessary in this case.\
\
					Users sometimes upgrade Mac OS X via "archive and install". After the installation, TeXShop\
					remains but teTeX is blown away. The first time such users typeset a file, they\
					see an error dialog reporting that "pdflatex cannot be found." This error dialog has\
					been revised to explain more clearly the likely cause, and resolution, of the\
					problem.\
\
					The TeXShop web page now contains a "LaTeX Documentation" section listing\
					recommended books and links to free LaTeX guides on the internet. The web page\
					also makes available a number of short LaTeX example files by Will Robertson.\

	Bugs Fixed:\
\
		When a large number of windows were open, switching from one window to\
		another took a long time and yielded a spinning disk; TeXShop was completely\
		unresponsive during this time. This slowdown was caused by a bug in the Macro \
		code. The problem is now fixed.\
\
		If a dvi file was opened in a directory without write permission, TeXShop could\
		not create and display a corresponding pdf file. Now it will create the pdf file\
		in a temporary directory and display it.\
\
		If the abort button was pushed in the console and the user later typed and\
		pushed RETURN, the program crashed. Fixed.\

\cf2 					\cf0 Two minor error dialogs, which should have appeared in a window, instead\
					appeared on the desktop with an inoperable "OK" button. This is fixed.\
\
					In localizations other than English, attempts to get the applescript dictionary\
					crashed TeXShop. Fixed.\
\
					The Bibtex, etc., tools in the source window did not work if a file had a root\
					file. Fixed.\

\cf0 Version 1.36		This version was never released.\
\
\
Versions 1.37 and 2.00		April 29, 2005\
\
	Version 2.00 uses PDFKit, which is new in system 10.4 (Tiger). Consequently it \
	requires Tiger. Version 1.37 contains all changes in 2.00 except those which depend on\
	PDFKit. If serious bugs are found in 1.37, they will be fixed in updates: 1.38, 1.39, etc.\
	However, TeXShop development from this point on will build from the 2.00 version,\
	and updates to 1.37 beyond bug fixes are unlikely.\
\
New Features in 2.00:\
						A new synchronization method has been added to TeXShop, using the ability in Tiger\
\pard\tx560\tx1120\tx1680\tx2240\tx2800\tx3360\tx3920\tx4480\tx5040\tx5600\tx6160\tx6720\ql\qnatural\pardirnatural
\cf0 				to search for strings in pdf files. The new method does not require including a\
				pdfsync.sty file, so it works out of the box on files typeset using any engine:\
				pdftex or pdflatex, TeX + ghoscript or LaTeX + ghostscript, XeTeX, and other engines.\
\
				Click on a word or phrase in the source file. TeXShop will scroll the preview window to the\
				corresponding phrase and circle it in red. Click on a word or phrase in the\
				preview window. TeXShop will open the corresponding source file if it is not already\
				open, scroll the source to the appropriate spot, and highlight the source phrase \
				in yellow. \
\
				A new TeXShop preference item selects the synchronization method to be used:\
				the old pdfsync method, the new search method, or a combination in which the\
				new search is used, but the program falls back on pdfsync if the new search does not\
				succeed. \
\pard\tx1440\tx2180\tx2800\tx4320\tx5760\tx7200\li1480\fi-20\ql\qnatural
\cf0 \
	PDFKit also makes the following features possible:\
\pard\tx560\tx1120\tx1680\tx2240\tx2800\tx3360\tx3920\tx4480\tx5040\tx5600\tx6160\tx6720\ql\qnatural\pardirnatural
\cf0 						\
					TeXShop supports hyperlinks. To activate this feature, add the line\
\
	\cf2 					\cf0 \\usepackage[colorlinks=true, pdfstartview=FitV, linkcolor=blue, \
							citecolor=blue, urlcolor=blue]\{hyperref\} \
	\cf2 \
					\cf0 to the heading of the source document. Links to external web sites can then be added\
					to tex documents using commands like\
	\cf2 \
						\cf0 \\href\{http://www.uoregon.edu/~koch/\}\{Koch homepage\} \
	\cf2 \
					\cf0 Links to other portions of the tex document can be added using commands like\
	\cf2 						\
						\cf0 \\hyperlink\{lemniscate\}\{Graph of Lemniscate\}\
\
					where the tag "lemniscate" is created using a command like\
\
						 \\hypertarget\{lemniscate\}\{\}\cf2 \\\cf0 \
	\cf2 \
					\cf0 To navigate with these links, choose the new "text" tool and clink\
					on the colored links.\
\pard\tx560\tx1120\tx1680\tx2240\tx2800\tx3360\tx3920\tx4480\tx5040\tx5600\tx6160\tx6720\ql\qnatural\pardirnatural
\cf2 \
				\cf0 The preview window toolbar contains "Back" and "Forward" buttons so one \
				can jump to a spot using a link, and then jump back.\
\
\cf2 				\cf0 Hyperref.sty automatically adds links to citations, so readers can rapidly jump from a citation to\
				the corresponding bibliography entry.\
\cf2 \
				\cf0 The hyperref package also creates a document outline. For example, the main outline of\
				a book is a list of chapters; each chapter entry contains a list of sections, and so forth. \
				To see this outline and navigate through the document with it, use the new "drawer" tool to \
				display the pdf window's drawer.\
\
	\cf2 			\cf0 The text tool can be used to select a portion of text in the preview window and copy\
				this selection to an editor. This differs from the "pdf selection tool" which copies a portion\
				of the document as a pdf illustration --- the text tool copies editable text.\
	\cf2 				\
				\cf0 Searching the pdf preview is supported. Use the search tools in the bottom half of\
				the window's drawer.\
	\cf2 \
				\cf0 PDFKit brings additional polish to the display of pdf documents. It supports documents with \
				isolated rotated pages, and correctly prints rotated pages in landscape mode. It supports \
				liveupdate of window resizing if the magnification preference is set to "fit to window." Etc.\
\
\
			New Features in 2.00 and 1.37\cf2 :\cf0 \
\cf2 \
				\cf0 The remaining new features are available in both new versions.\
\cf2 \
				\cf0 Earlier versions of TeXShop allowed users to set the typesetting engine of a file, its \
				encoding, and its root file by adding appropriate comments to the top of the source file. For example,\
				the following commands set the typesetting engine to xelatex, the encoding to UTF-8 Unicode,\
				and the root file to ../Main.tex:\
\cf2 \
					\cf0  %\cf3 &xelatex\cf0 \
\cf2 					\cf0 %\cf3 &encoding\cf0 = UTF-8 Unicode\
\cf2 					\cf0 %SourceDoc ../Main.tex\
\cf2 \
				\cf0 But this syntax was a mistake because the symbols "%\cf3 &\cf0 " are reserved for the use of TeX.\
\cf2 				\cf0 In versions 1.37 and 2.00 of TeXShop, the syntax has been changed to the following.\
				Each such line must occur within the first twenty lines of the document.\
\cf2 \
					\cf0 %!TEX TS-program = xelatex\
\cf2 					\cf0 %!TEX encoding = UTF-8 Unicode\
\cf2 					\cf0 %!TEX root = ../Main.tex\
\cf2 \
				\cf0 It you used the earlier facility, you need to change your old source files to the new syntax. I'm\
				very sorry to cause this work, but the change is really necessary. This syntax is mentioned in the\
				description of version 1.35, but this change was not actually released until this version.\
\
				If you are in the middle of a project and cannot make the change now, you can temporarily\
				set a hidden preference to revert to the old syntax. To do so, open Apple's Terminal program and\
				type \
\cf2 \
					\cf0 defaults write TeXShop UseOldHeadingCommands YES\
\cf2 \
				\cf0 Once this is done, the new commands will be recognized but the old commands will also work.\
				However, I recommend turning this preference off as soon as possible.\
\cf2 \
				\cf0 Commands have been added to the default Macros menu which insert the symbols \
				"%!TEX TS-program = " and "%!TEX encoding = " and "%!TEX root = " into the source document; \
				new users will see these entries. Users who are upgrading can easily add these symbols as well. \
				To add the program entry, choose "Open Macro Editor" under the Macro menu. Click the "New Item" \
				button, name the item "Program" and set its content to\
\cf2 \
					\cf0 %!TEX TS-program =  #INS# \
\cf2 \
				\cf0 Repeat for the "Encoding" and "Root" items. \cf2 <\cb4 /li\cb1 >\cf0 \
\cf2 \
				\cf0 Martin Kerz added a "Check for Updates..." command to TeXShop. \
\
				Martin Kerz also designed the new TeXShop web page. Thanks! \
\cf2 	\
				\cf0 OgreKit for searching has been upgraded to the latest 2.0.1 version.\
\
\cf2 				\cf0 Additional filetypes can be edited, including files with extensions "abc", "bst", "bib", "lp", and\
				"pdf". The addition of "pdf" allows TeXShop to be chosen as the default pdf viewer. A new pdf icon\
				has been created so the system can use it on pdf files it will display in TeXShop. \
\
\cf2 				\cf0 David Reitter modified the selection code so if the user clicks on a control word like\
				\\gamma, the initial "\\" symbol will also be chosen. \
\
				A new preference item "Select on Activate" was added. When this item is checked, a mouse click\
				on the text window will select this window and also place the cursor at the spot that was clicked. If\
				the item is not checked, the initial mouse click will only activate the window. A separate click is then\
				needed to position the cursor.\
\
\cf2 				\cf0 New hidden preferences were added for users who change the default foreground and background \
				colors of the editing window. These preferences set the color of the insertion point (without these \
				preferences, the insertion point could become invisible). To set the insertion point to white, for example,\
\cf2 					\
					\cf0 defaults write TeXShop insertionpoint_R 1.0 \
\cf2 					\cf0 defaults write TeXShop insertionpoint_G 1.0 \
\cf2 					\cf0 defaults write TeXShop insertionpoint_B 1.0 \
\
				Recall the defaults to set the text foreground color in the editing window (introduced already in 1.35)\
\
					defaults write TeXShop foreground_R  0.3\
\pard\tx560\tx1120\tx1680\tx2240\tx2800\tx3360\tx3920\tx4480\tx5040\tx5600\tx6160\tx6720\ql\qnatural
\cf0 					defaults write TeXShop foreground_G  0.3\
					defaults write TeXShop foreground_B  0.3\
\
				Also recall the defaults to set the text background color in the editing window (introduced already\
				in 1.28)\
\
					defaults write TeXShop background_R .42\

		defaults write TeXShop background_B .77\

\cf2 \
				\cf0 When a file is typeset, all open changed files with the same root\
				are first saved.\
\
				New Japanese Help by Yoshihisa Okazaki with help from Seiji Zenitani.\
\
				A proxy icon is now added to the title of the preview window. This icon can be \
				dragged to the desktop or other folders to create a copy of the pdf file. The source \
				window has always had a proxy icon. Thanks to Rene Donner for suggesting this \
				feature and explaining how to implement it.\
\
				If the user tries to open a file with UTF-8 Unicode encoding, but\
				the file is not a legal utf8 file, a dialog now appears:\
\
					This file is not encoded in UTF-8 Unicode.\
\
					The file has been opened with MacOSRoman encoding.\
					If that is not correct, close it and open again with an\
					appropriate encoding.\
\
				This change is mainly for people trying to open a fine with \
				UTF-8 Encoding when the file was not coded for UTF-8 Unicode. \
				A random collection of bytes will almost never be a legal \
				UTF-8 Unicode file. Note that usually TeXShop cannot tell the \
				correct encoding for other encoding defaults. For example, a Latin1 file will open fine in \
				MacOSRoman encoding, though some of the letters may be wrong. \
\
				New Spanish help files and localization\
\
				bib files are promoted to full class citizens; text can be dragged in them,\
				syntax coloring works, etc.\
\
				This is a remark rather than a bug fix. Users have reported that they\
				can no longer "find" words in the console window. Actually, they can. This\
				window has two portions. When typesetting ends, the bottom portion is active,\
				so the Find panel searches that portion and beeps when it finds nothing.\
				To activate the top, click on it. Now Find works.\
\cf2 \
\
			Bugs Fixed:\cf0 \
				\
				TeXShop has always had a "Revert To Saved" item under the File menu, but it has never worked!\
				Sorry. This is fixed. \
\
\cf2 				\cf0 Improvements were made in the pdfsync code.\
\
				In previous versions, it was possible to add a Macro button to the\
				Preview Window Toolbar in English, but not in other localizations. This is\
				fixed thanks to Juan Luis Varona.\
\
				Japanese Image Copy Type Preference didn't work, due to incorrect localization.\
				Now fixed.\
\
				 Command Completion was repaired; the configuration file is now loaded and\
				saved in UTF-8 Unicode, and the first line of the file, opened with\
				Format --> Completion --> Open Completion File, is\
\
					%!TEX encoding = UTF-8 Unicode\
\
				Users who are upgrading and work with unicode scripts should select the menu item\
				Format --> Completion --> Open Completion File... and add this line to the\
				top of the file. \
\
				When typesetting engines are called, they are now passed the\
				program filename with extension, rather than just the filename\
\
				Conversion of eps, ps, and dvi files to pdf (caused by opening such a file)\
				now works even if the path to the file has folders whose names contain spaces.\
				In all three cases, the file can now be in a folder without write permission.\
\
				In 1.35, it was only possible to switch between the OgreKit Find panel\
				and the Apple Find panel in the English localization. This preference now\
				always works.\
		\
				Trash AUX Files now removes files with more extensions:\
\
					ccs, idv, 4ct, 4tc, lg, xref (from TeX4ht; request of Bob Kerstetter)\
					ttt, fff, ent (from endfloat and endnotes; request of Herb Schulz)\
					wrm (from WARMreader; request of Gary Gray)\
\
\pard\tx1440\tx2180\tx2800\tx4320\tx5760\tx7200\li1480\fi-20\ql\qnatural
\cf0 	The list doesn't contain dvi (never did). I've removed bbl at the\
	request of Lawrence Paulson, Gary Gray, ADITYA TRIVEDI, and Josep Font.\
\
	The menu item to bring up the statistics panel was only in the\
	English version. Now it is in all versions.\
\
	Further pdfsync fixes from source to preview. If a project\
	had a SourceDoc ./main.tex line instead of a SourceDoc main.tex line,\
	pdfsync could fail. This is fixed.\
\
