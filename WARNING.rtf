\f0\fs24 \cf0 WARNING:\
\
The Resources/TeXShop/New file contains a hidden file named\
".Versions". This file lists the version of TeXShop which created \
~/Library/TeXShop/New. For instance, it might contain a single\
line\
\
	2.32\
\
Because of this line, a user who temporarily runs an older version\
of TeXShop won't overwrite ~/Library/TeXShop.\
\
Moreover, nothing will be written if version 2.32 runs more than\
once. After that, only 2.33 or higher can rewrite ~/Library/TeXShop.\
The "remove a folder entirely and let TeXShop regenerate it" trick,\
however, always works regardless of this entry.}
