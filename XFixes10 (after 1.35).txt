Changes since 1.35

1) New German Localization and Help Files

2) Japanese Image Copy Type Preference didn't work, due to incorrect localization.
Now fixed.

3) Command Completion was repaired; the configuration file is now loaded and
saved in UTF-8 Unicode, and the first line of the file, opened with
Format --> Completion --> Open Completion File, is

	%&encoding=UTF-8 Unicode

4) Extensive work on pdfsync in both directions to fix errors.

5) When typesetting engines are called, they are now passed the
program filename with extension, rather than just the filename

6) Now uses version 1.2.4 of OgreKit

7) Conversion of eps, ps, and dvi files to pdf (caused by opening such a file)
now works even if the path to the file has folders whose names contain spaces.
In all three cases, the file can now be in a folder without write permission.
There is one case that still fails: 

	file is a "dvi" file, containing folder does not have
	write permission, and there is a space in some folder's name
	in the path leading to the file

8) In 1.35, it was only possible to switch between the OgreKit Find panel
and the Apple Find panel in the English localization. This preference now
always works. To fix this, I had to add a line to the OgreKit Library file
which modifies a program's Find menu. The code checks the Find Panel preference
and returns if it is set to the Apple Find panel.

9) Trash AUX Files now removes files with more extensions:

	ccs, idv, 4ct, 4tc, lg, xref (from TeX4ht; request of Bob Kerstetter)
	
	ttt, fff, ent (from endfloat and endnotes; request of Herb Schulz)

	wrm (from WARMreader; request of Gary Gray)

The list doesn't contain dvi (never did). I've removed bbl at the
request of Lawrence Paulson, Gary Gray, ADITYA TRIVEDI, and Josep Font.

10) I modified the English Help advanced_removeaux.htm to reflect this
new list.
