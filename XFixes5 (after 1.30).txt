Changes since 1.30

1) Fixed a bug reported by Luis Sequeira: when text was dragged within
the source window, it was always copied and pasted. It should have been cut and
pasted unless the option key was down. This is fixed. 

2) Slightly improved Spanish help by Juan Luis Varona Malumbres (small
icon for the list of help files in the drawer).
