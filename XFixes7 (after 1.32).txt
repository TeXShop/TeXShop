Changes since 1.32

1) Now "Select All" can be used to select the full page of
pdf output in selection mode. There is one restriction;
in Multi-Page mode and Double-Multi-Page mode, select all is
only active if the document has at most 20 pages, since
otherwise the selected pdf would be enormous and bring the
machine to a crawl.

2) Fixed a strange bug in 10.2.8 (and possibly earlier systems)
reported by Jerry Keough. If you have set preferences
so no empty window opens at startup, and if you open a
document, make the pdf window active, and then close the source
window, the next time you use the menu, the program will crash.
This bug does not occur on Panther.

Investigation shows that the problem lies in the sequence of
notifications sent when windows close or become active. In
Panther, the notifications are sent in the following order for
the above sequence:

	pdf close
	document active
	document close

as expected. In 10.2.8 (and probably in 10.2 in general)

	document close
	pdf close
	document active

so the system believes that a document is active when, in fact, it
no longer exists. The menu crash occurs when the menu code asks a
document which no longer exists to describe its state.

The fix is a litte scary. When a document closes, I make an explicit
call to TSWindowManager to report that the document is closed. 
In Panther, investigation shows that this call occurs as follows:

	pdf close
	document active
	new call
	document close

and in 10.2.8 it occurs as follows

	document close
	pdf close
	document active
	new call

Notice that this new call is only sent when the entire document
is closing. So both orders are correct.

Experiments also show that if a second window is waiting to become
active, it's "document active" message is sent after all of these
calls in both cases.

3) Added additional code for drag and drop by Zenitani. See the previous
XFixes6 for the basic idea of this code. The new version reports an
error if the filename of the dropped file contains a space. The new
code also permits customization. The method of customization is
easy to work with, but perhaps the design is a little strange:
customization is done with the Macro menu. Insert a new submenu
titled "Drag & Drop". Inside items under this menu like
".pdf"; each item is a file extension. Insert the code that should
be included in the body of this item; for instance, the code for
.pdf might be "\includegraphics[#INS#]{%r}" In these inclusions,

	%F full path of an dropped file
	%f dropped filename
	%r relative path of the dropped file
	%n filename without extension
	%e extension.

If an extension is not mentioned in the Macro Editor, then it is
handled in the default manner Zenitani previously defined. Thus for
most people, no macro "Drag & Drop" submenu is needed.

4) Some users report that tex pages appear with slightly colored
background --- yellow, bluish, or whatever. Frank Stengel discovered that
removing a NSEraseRect call from the print drawing routine fixed this
problem. This call has been removed.

Incidentally, this makes TeXShop printing of typeset files completely
vanilla. The drawRect routine which does the actual drawing of the
printed image has only one line: [myRep draw]. So print drawing
is now done entirely by internal Cocoa classes.

5) German help has been updated by Martin Kerz

6) The Italian localization has been updated by Nicola Vitacolonna

7) Spanish help has been updated by Juan Luis Varona Malumbres

8) Added #NAMEPATH# for Claus Gerhardt

9) Added a Romanian localization by Andrei Teleman. Thanks!

10) The French localization has been updated by Hendrik Chaltin

11) A version was briefly on the web with slightly broken drag-and-drop
code, now fixed. The broken version always inserted \include, and
never \includegraphics, etc.

12) A preference item now allows users to distill with Apple's pstopdf
rather than ghostscript. Warning: a few tex scripts (but none in
TeXShop) may still call ghostscript; the most important is
epstopdf.sty. If the Panther distiller is chosen but the user's
system is below 10.3, distill operations continue to call
ghostscript.

13) Refixed command completion (!!). Now pushing ESC should complete
commands in the command completion list. Moreover, the Panther
(ESC + option) method of completing commands should work again.

14) Added the Macros menu to the preview window toolbar. Also
modified this menu so appletalk scripts are always active and
"insert text" scripts are only active when the source window is
the front window.

15) TeXShop has an applescript command to add text. This command did
not update the undo stack, so applying the command and then choosing
undo would confuse the program. This was fixed by Stefan Walsen
and his patch is applied in this version of TeXShop.

16) Added the following Applescript commands to TeXShop:

	latex
	tex
	bibtex
	makeindex
	context
	metapost
	refreshpdf
	taskdone

The first five call the usual typesetting commands, using the
document choice of "pdftex" or "tex and ghostscript" to typeset,
and update the preview display at the end. These commands return
immediately before typesetting is done, so listing several typesetting
commands in one Applescript is dangerous. While typesetting, the
taskdone command will return "NO", and it will return "YES" once
the command is finished. This makes it possible to call several
typesetting commands from one script. Here, for instance, is a script
to do a complete bibtex job:

 --Applescript

 tell front document of application "TeXShop"
	latex

	repeat
		delay 2
		if taskdone
			exit repeat
		end if
	end repeat

	bibtex

	repeat
		delay 2
		if taskdone
			exit repeat
		end if
	end repeat

	latex

	repeat
		delay 2
		if taskdone
			exit repeat
		end if
	end repeat

	latex

	repeat
		delay 2
		if taskdone
			exit repeat
		end if
	end repeat

end tell

The command "refreshpdf" opens the preview window if necessary,
and then in all cases updates the pdf display to the current version,
leaving user page choices and other choices unchanged. Here is
a typeical call:

	tell front document of application "TeXShop"
		refreshpdf
	end tell

17) A new preference item turns on "continuous pdf updating" for the
pdf preview window when the window is opened for an external
editor. Such windows are opened by the "Open for Preview..." menu
command, or by the "Open..." command if the program is configured
for an external editor. In this mode, the program updates the window
automatically when the pdf file changes.

18) Added an "Abort" button to the console for people who want to
stop the typesetting program in midstream. This is a minor change.

19) Added a patch by Elliott Hughes; this patch cleans up some of
the code calling a tex, latex, bibtex, etc., task. The crucial 
feature of the patch is that if the bin file is not found, an
error message appears explaining this and asking if the
preferences bin path is correct. Thus people who use fink will
be warned if they forget to change the preference.

20) Added an additional applescript command:

	open_for_externaleditor

This command is understood by the entire application, and the
syntax of calling it is

	tell application "TeXShop"
		open_for_externaleditor at "/Users/koch/TestFile.tex"
	end tell

Obviously, this opens a tex file for external editing; recall that
the preview window will appear rather than the source window.

21) Added the command "refreshtext" to similarly refresh a window
holding text. 

22) Added #DOCUMENTNAME# This is the name of the document, and can
be used in the command

	tell document #DOCUMENTNAME# of application "TeXShop"
		latex
	end tell

Warning: this variable is subtle. It contains an extension if the
user asks to "show extensions" but no extension otherwise. The
"tell document #DOCUMENTNAME# requires that these settings match.

23) Added a hidden preference

	defaults write TeXShop RefreshTime  4.00

sets the number of seconds between attempts to see if the pdf
file has changed. The default right now is 4, but this is to allow
us to experiment with the correct value.

24) Added another hidden preference

	defaults write TeXShop PdfFileRefresh YES

If continuous refreshing is set to on in preference and this is set
to YES, then when pdf files are opened, they also automatically
refresh. Previously, only files "opened for Preview" refreshed.
The default value for this is NO.

25) Added a new document script command

	typeset

26) Added new document script commands

	latexinteractive
	texinteractive
	bibtexinteractive
	contextinteractive
	metapostinteractive
	makeindexinteractive
	typesetinteractive

These are exactly like their noninteractive counterparts except
that they should only be called from an applescript running from a
program other than TeXShop, and when they are called the typesetting commands do NOT run continuously, so the user has a change to inspect errors, push return, etc. The point is that when applescript is called 
from another application, then the event loop is still running
in TeXShop and user interaction is possible.
