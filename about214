Added localizations in French, German, Spanish, and Japanese. Fixed the dialogs Line, Print Source, and Set Project Root so "OK" and "Cancel" work again, by retreating from a stupid change to Horn's correct fix. Changed Pref text to give "simpdftex" as default rather than "altpdftex". Fixed Help files so choosing a file already open brings it to the front. Fixed a significant bug: in the past, opening a graphic, dvi, or ps file first opened the file as text, even though the text window would not appear. This also happened when opening a file for an external editor. This bug is fixed; a nice side effect is that graphic files open MUCH faster. Revised version to 2.14.
