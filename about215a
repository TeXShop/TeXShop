Fixed foreground color in source as follows:

In TSDocument-Syntax.m, colorizeText, commented out the line

	[layoutManager removeTemporaryAttribute:NSForegroundColorAttributeName forCharacterRange:colorRange];

and in TSDocument-Syntax.m, reColor, commented out the lines

	[[textView1 layoutManager] removeTemporaryAttribute:NSForegroundColorAttributeName forCharacterRange:theRange];
	[[textView2 layoutManager] removeTemporaryAttribute:NSForegroundColorAttributeName forCharacterRange:theRange];


In TSDocument.m, setupTextView, added the lines

	foregroundColor = [NSColor colorWithCalibratedRed: [SUD floatForKey:foreground_RKey]
		green: [SUD floatForKey:foreground_GKey]
		blue: [SUD floatForKey:foreground_BKey]
		alpha:1.0];

and later

	[aTextView setTextColor: foregroundColor];




Also activated PDF window when it was updated during "automatic updating":

In TSDocument.m

	refreshPDFAndBringFront

in the section at the end starting if (front), added the line

	[[NSApplication sharedApplication] activateIgnoringOtherApps: YES];
